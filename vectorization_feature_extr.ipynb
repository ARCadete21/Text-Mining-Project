going he didnt look her way nor no other way except straight ahead so janie ran to the pump and jerked the handle hard while she pumped it made a loud noise and also made her heavy hair fall down so

without knowing it she turned wrongside out just standing there and feeling when the throbbing calmed a little she gave logans speech a hard thought and placed it beside other things she had seen and heard when she had finished with that she dumped the dough on the skillet and smoothed it over with her hand she wasnt even angry logan was accusing her of her mamma her grandmama and her feelings and she couldnt do a thing about any of it the sowbelly in the pan needed turning she flipped it over and shoved it back a little cold water in the coffee pot to settle it turned the hocake with a plate and then made a little laugh what was she losing so much time for a feeling of sudden newness and change came over her janie hurried out of the front gate and turned south even if joe was not there waiting for her the change was bound to do her goodthe morning road air was like a new dress that made her feel the apron tied around her waist she untied it and flung it on a low bush beside the road and walked on picking flowers and making a bouquet after that she came to where joe starks was waiting for her with a hired rig he was very solemn and helped her to the seat beside him with him on it it sat like some high ruling chair from now on until death she was going to have flower dust and springtime sprinkled over everything a bee for her bloom her old thoughts were going to come in handy now but new words would have to be made and said to fit themgreen cove springs he told the driver so they were married there before sundown just like joe had said with new clothes of silk and woolthey sat on the boarding house porch and saw the sun plunge into the same crack in the earth from which the night emerged',\n",

       " 'the late trial at colognedecember 22 1852you will have ere this received by the european papers numerous reports of the communist monster trial at cologne prussia and of its result but as none of the reports is anything like a faithful statement of the facts and as these facts throw a glaring light upon the political means by which the continent of europe is kept in bondage i consider it necessary to revert to this trialthe communist or proletarian party as well as other parties had lost by suppression of the rights of association and meeting the means of giving to itself a legal organization on the continent its leaders besides had been exiled from their countries but no political party can exist without an organization and that organization which both the liberal bourgeois and the democratic shopkeeping class were enabled more or less to supply by the social station advantages and longestablished everyday intercourse of their members the proletarian class without such social station and pecuniary means was necessarily compelled to seek in secret association hence both in france and germany sprung up those numerous secret societies which have ever since 1849 one after another been discovered by the police and prosecuted as conspiracies but if many of them were really conspiracies formed with the actual intention of upsetting the government for the time beingand he is a coward that under certain circumstances would not conspire just as he is a fool who under other circumstances would do sothere were some other societies which were formed with a wider and more elevated purpose which knew that the upsetting of an existing government was but a passing stage in the great impending struggle and which intended to keep together and to prepare the party whose nucleus they formed for the last decisive combat which must one day or another crush forever in europe the domination not of mere tyrants despots and usurpers but of a power far superior and far more formidable than theirs that of capital over laborthe organization of the advanced communist party in germany was of this kind in accordance with the principles of the manifesto11 published in 1848 and with those explained in the series of articles on revolution and counterrevolution in germany published in the new york daily tribune this party never imagined itself capable of producing at any time and at its pleasure that revolution which was to carry its ideas into practice it studied the causes that had produced the revolutionary movement in 1848 and the causes that made them fail recognizing the social antagonism of classes at the bottom of all political struggles it applied itself to the study of the conditions under which one class of society can and must be called on to represent the whole of the interests of a nation and thus politically to rule over it history showed to the communist party how after the landed aristocracy of the middle ages the monied power of the first capitalists arose and seized the reins of government how the social influence and political rule of this financial section of capitalists was superseded by the rising strength since the introduction of steam of the manufacturing capitalists and how at the present moment two more classes claim their turn of domination the petty trading class and the industrial working class the practical revolutionary experience of 18481849 confirmed the reasonings of theory which led to the conclusion that the democracy of the petty traders must first have its turn before the communist working class could hope to permanently establish itself in power and destroy that system of wageslavery which keeps it under the yoke of the bourgeoisie thus the secret organization of the communists could not have the direct purpose of upsetting the present governments of germany being formed to upset not these but the insurrectionary government which is sooner or later to follow them its members might and certainly would individually lend an active hand to a revolutionary movement against the present status quo in its turn but the preparation of such a movement otherwise than by spreading of communist opinions by the masses could not be an object of the association so well was this foundation of the society understood by the majority of its members that when the placehunting ambition of some tried to turn it into a conspiracy for making an extempore revolution they were speedily turned outnow according to no law upon the face of the earth could such an association be called a plot a conspiracy for purposes of high treason if it was a conspiracy it was one against not the existing government but its probable successor and the prussian government was aware of it that was the cause why the eleven defendants were kept in solitary confinement during eighteen months spent on the part of the authorities in the strangest judicial feats imagine that after eight months detention the prisoners were remanded for some months more there being no evidence of any crime against them and when at last they were brought before a jury there was not a single overt act of a treasonable nature proved against them and yet they were convicted and you will speedily see howone of the emissaries of the society was arrested in may 1851 and from documents found upon him other arrests followed a prussian police officer a certain stieber was immediately ordered to trace the ramifications in london of the pretended plot he succeeded in obtaining some papers connected with the abovementioned seceders from the society who had after being turned out formed an actual conspiracy in paris and london these papers were obtained by a double crime a man named reuter was bribed to break open the writingdesk of the secretary of the society and steal the papers therefrom but that was nothing yet this theft led to the discovery and conviction of the socalled francogerman plot in paris but it gave no clue as to the great communist association the paris plot we may as well here observe was under the direction of a few ambitious imbeciles and political chevaliers dindustrie in london and of a formerly convicted forger then acting as a police spy in paris their dupes made up by rabid declamations and bloodthirsty rantings for the utter insignificance of their political existencethe prussian police then had to look out for fresh discoveries they established a regular office of secret police at the prussian embassy in london a police agent greif by name held his odious vocation under the title of an attach to the embassya step which should suffice to put all prussian embassies out of the pale of international law and which even the austrians have not yet dared to take under him worked a certain fleury a merchant in the city of london a man of some fortune and rather respectably connected one of those low creatures who do the basest actions from an innate inclination to infamy another agent was a commercial clerk named hirsch who however had already been denounced as a spy on his arrival he introduced himself into the society of some german communist refugees in london and they in order to obtain proofs of his real character admitted him for a short time the proofs of his connection with the police were very soon obtained and herr hirsch from that time absented himself although however he thus resigned all opportunities of gaining the information he was paid to procure he was not inactive from his retreat in kensington where he never met one of the communists in question he manufactured every week pretended reports of pretended sittings of a pretended central committee of that very conspiracy which the prussian police could not get hold of the contents of these reports were of the most absurd nature not a christian name was correct not a name correctly spelt not a single individual made to speak as he would be likely to speak his master fleury assisted him in this forgery and it is not yet proved that attach greif can wash his hands of these infamous proceedings the prussian government incredible to say took these silly fabrications for gospel truth and you may imagine what a confusion such depositions created in the evidence brought before the jury when the trial came on herr stieber the already mentioned police officer got into the witnessbox swore to all these absurdities and with no little selfcomplacency maintained that he had a secret agent in the very closest intimacy with those parties in london who were considered the prime movers in this awful conspiracy this secret agent was very secret indeed for he had hid his face for eight months in kensington for fear he might actually see one of the parties whose most secret thoughts words and doings he pretended to report week after weekmessrs hirsch and fleury however had another invention in store they worked up the whole of the reports they had made into an original minute book of the sittings of the secret supreme committee whose existence was maintained by the prussian police and herr stieber finding that this book wondrously agreed with the reports already received from the same parties at once laid it before the jury declaring upon his oath that after serious examination and according to his fullest conviction that book was genuine it was then that most of the absurdities reported by hirsch were made public you may imagine the surprise of the pretended members of that secret committee when they found things stated of them which they never knew before some who were baptized william were here christened louis or charles others at the time they were at the other end of england were made to have pronounced speeches in london others were reported to have read letters they never had received they were made to have met regularly on a thursday when they used to have a convivial reunion once a week on wednesdays a working man who could hardly write figured as one of the takers of minutes and signed as such and they all of them were made to speak in a language which if it may be that of prussian police stations was certainly not that of a reunion in which literary men favorably known in their country formed the majority and to crown the whole a receipt was forged for a sum of money pretended to have been paid by the fabricators to the pretended secretary of the fictitious central committee for this book but the existence of this pretended secretary rested merely upon a hoax that some malicious communist had played upon the unfortunate hirschthis clumsy fabrication was too scandalous an affair not to produce the contrary of its intended effect although the london friends of the defendants were deprived of all means to bring the facts of the case before the juryalthough the letters they sent to the counsel for the defence were suppressed by the postalthough the documents and affidavits they succeeded in getting into the hands of these legal gentlemen were not admitted in evidence yet the general indignation was such that even the public accusers nay even herr stieberwhose oath had been given as a guarantee for the authenticity of that bookwere compelled to recognize it as a forgerythis forgery however was not the only thing of the kind of which the police was guilty two or three more cases of the sort came out during the trial the documents stolen by reuter were interpolated by the police so as to disfigure their meaning a paper containing some rabid nonsense was written in a handwriting imitating that of dr marx and for a time it was pretended that it had been written by him until at last the prosecution was obliged to acknowledge the forgery but for every police infamy that was proved as such there were five or six fresh ones brought forward which could not at the moment be unveiled the defence being taken by surprise the proofs having to be got from london and every correspondence of the counsel for the defence with the london communist refugees being in open court treated as complicity in the alleged plotthat greif and fleury are what they are here represented to be has been stated by herr stieber himself in his evidence as to hirsch he has before a london magistrate confessed that he forged the minute book by order and with the assistance of fleury and then made his escape from this country in order to evade a criminal prosecutionthe government could stand few such branding disclosures as came to light during the trial it had a jurysix nobles two government officials these were not the men to look closely into the confused mass of evidence heaped before them during six weeks when they heard it continually dinned into their ears that the defendants were the chiefs of a dreadful communist conspiracy got up in order to subvert everything sacredproperty family religion order government and law and yet had not the government at the same time brought it to the knowledge of the privileged classes that an acquittal in this trial would be the signal for the suppression of the jury and that it would be taken as a direct political demonstrationas a proof of the middleclass liberal opposition being ready to unite even with the most extreme revolutioniststhe verdict would have been an acquittal as it was the retroactive application of the new prussian code enabled the government to have seven prisoners convicted while four merely were acquitted and those convicted were sentenced to imprisonment varying from three to six years as you have doubtless already stated at the time the news reached youlondon december 1 1852footnotes11 the manifesto this is the celebrated communist manifesto which the communist congress held in london november 1847 delegated marx and engels to draw up it was published in 1848 in london the fundamental proposition of the manifesto engels writes in his introduction to the communist manifesto translated by s moore and published by w reeves is that in every historical epoch the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange and the social organization necessarily following from it form the basis upon which is built up and from which alone can be explained the political and intellectual history of that epoch that consequently the whole history of mankind has been a history of class struggles contests between exploiting and exploited ruling and oppressed classes that nowadays a stage has been reached where the exploited and oppressed classthe proletariatcannot attain its emancipation without at the same time and once and for all emancipating society at large from all exploitation oppression class distinctions and class struggles as to this fundamental proposition of the manifesto it belongs says

       " 'part the secondsnitchey and craggs had a snug little office on the old battle ground where they drove a snug little business and fought a great many small pitched battles for a great many contending parties though it could hardly be said of these conflicts that they were running fights for in truth they generally proceeded at a snails pace the part the firm had in them came so far within the general denomination that now they took a shot at this plaintiff and now aimed a chop at that defendant now made a heavy charge at an estate in chancery and now had some light skirmishing among an irregular body of small debtors just as the occasion served and the enemy happened to present himself the gazette was an important and profitable feature in some of their fields as in fields of greater renown and in most of the actions wherein they showed their generalship it was afterwards observed by the combatants that they had had great difficulty in making each other out or in knowing with any degree of distinctness what they were about in consequence of the vast amount of smoke by which they were surroundedthe offices of messrs snitchey and craggs stood convenient with an open door down two smooth steps in the marketplace so that any angry farmer inclining towards hot water might tumble into it at once their special councilchamber and hall of conference was an old backroom upstairs with a low dark ceiling which seemed to be knitting its brows gloomily in the consideration of tangled points of law it was furnished with some highbacked leathern chairs garnished with great goggleeyed brass nails of which every here and there two or three had fallen out or had been picked out perhaps by the wandering thumbs and forefingers of bewildered clients there was a framed print of a great judge in it every curl in whose dreadful wig had made a mans hair stand on end bales of papers filled the dusty closets shelves and tables and round the wainscot there were tiers of boxes padlocked and fireproof with peoples names painted outside which anxious visitors felt themselves by a cruel enchantment obliged to spell backwards and forwards and to make anagrams of while they sat seeming to listen to snitchey and craggs without comprehending one word of what they saidsnitchey and craggs had each in private life as in professional existence a partner of his own snitchey and craggs were the best friends in the world and had a real confidence in one another but mrs snitchey by a dispensation not uncommon in the affairs of life was on principle suspicious of mr craggs and mrs craggs was on principle suspicious of mr snitchey your snitcheys indeed the latter lady would observe sometimes to mr craggs using that imaginative plural as if in disparagement of an objectionable pair of pantaloons or other articles not possessed of a singular number i dont see what you want with your snitcheys for my part you trust a great deal too much to your snitcheys i think and i hope you may never find my words come true while mrs snitchey would observe to mr snitchey of craggs that if ever he was led away by man he was led away by that man and that if ever she read a double purpose in a mortal eye she read that purpose in craggss eye notwithstanding this however they were all very good friends in general and mrs snitchey and mrs craggs maintained a close bond of alliance against the office which they both considered the blue chamber and common enemy full of dangerous because unknown machinationsin this office nevertheless snitchey and craggs made honey for their several hives here sometimes they would linger of a fine evening at the window of their councilchamber overlooking the old battleground and wonder but that was generally at assize time when much business had made them sentimental at the folly of mankind who couldnt always be at peace with one another and go to law comfortably here days and weeks and months and years passed over them their calendar the gradually diminishing number of brass nails in the leathern chairs and the increasing bulk of papers on the tables here nearly three years flight had thinned the one and swelled the other since the breakfast in the orchard when they sat together in consultation at nightnot alone but with a man of about thirty or that time of life negligently dressed and somewhat haggard in the face but well made wellattired and welllooking who sat in the armchair of state with one hand in his breast and the other in his dishevelled hair pondering moodily messrs snitchey and craggs sat opposite each other at a neighbouring desk one of the fireproof boxes unpadlocked and opened was upon it a part of its contents lay strewn upon the table and the rest was then in course of passing through the hands of mr snitchey who brought it to the candle document by document looked at every paper singly as he produced it shook his head and handed it to mr craggs who looked it over also shook his head and laid it down sometimes they would stop and shaking their heads in concert look towards the abstracted client and the name on the box being michael warden esquire we may conclude from these premises that the name and the box were both his and that the affairs of michael warden esquire were in a bad waythats all said mr snitchey turning up the last paperreally theres no other resource no other resourceall lost spent wasted pawned borrowed and sold eh said the client looking upall returned mr snitcheynothing else to be done you saynothing at allthe client bit his nails and pondered againand i am not even personally safe in england you hold to that do youin no part of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland replied mr snitcheya mere prodigal son with no father to go back to no swine to keep and no husks to share with them eh pursued the client rocking one leg over the other and searching the ground with his eyesmr snitchey coughed as if to deprecate the being supposed to participate in any figurative illustration of a legal position mr craggs as if to express that it was a partnership view of the subject also coughedruined at thirty said the client humphnot ruined mr warden returned snitchey not so bad as that you have done a good deal towards it i must say but you are not ruined a little nursing a little devil said the clientmr craggs said snitchey will you oblige me with a pinch of snuff thank you siras the imperturbable lawyer applied it to his nose with great apparent relish and a perfect absorption of his attention in the proceeding the client gradually broke into a smile and looking up saidyou talk of nursing how long nursinghow long nursing repeated snitchey dusting the snuff from his fingers and making a slow calculation in his mind for your involved estate sir in good hands s and cs say six or seven yearsto starve for six or seven years said the client with a fretful laugh and an impatient change of his positionto starve for six or seven years mr warden said snitchey would be very uncommon indeed you might get another estate by showing yourself the while but we dont think you could do it speaking for self and craggs and consequently dont advise itwhat do you advisenursing i say repeated snitchey some few years of nursing by self and craggs would bring it round but to enable us to make terms and hold terms and you to keep terms you must go away you must live abroad as to starvation we could ensure you some hundreds ayear to starve upon even in the beginning i dare say mr wardenhundreds said the client and i have spent thousandsthat retorted mr snitchey putting the papers slowly back into the castiron box there is no doubt about no doubt about he repeated to himself as he thoughtfully pursued his occupationthe lawyer very likely knew his man at any rate his dry shrewd whimsical manner had a favourable influence on the clients moody state and disposed him to be more free and unreserved or perhaps the client knew his man and had elicited such encouragement as he had received to render some purpose he was about to disclose the more defensible in appearance gradually raising his head he sat looking at his immovable adviser with a smile which presently broke into a laughafter all he said my ironheaded friend mr snitchey pointed out his partner self and excuse me craggsi beg mr craggss pardon said the client after all my iron headed friends he leaned forward in his chair and dropped his voice a little you dont know half my ruin yetmr snitchey stopped and stared at him mr craggs also staredi am not only deep in debt said the client but i am deep in not in love cried snitcheyyes said the client falling back in his chair and surveying the firm with his hands in his pockets deep in loveand not with an heiress sir said snitcheynot with an heiressnor a rich ladynor a rich lady that i know of except in beauty and merita single lady i trust said mr snitchey with great expressioncertainlyits not one of dr jeddlers daughters said snitchey suddenly squaring his elbows on his knees and advancing his face at least a yardyes returned the clientnot his younger daughter said snitcheyyes returned the clientmr craggs said snitchey much relieved will you oblige me with another pinch of snuff thank you i am happy to say it dont signify mr warden shes engaged sir shes bespoke my partner can corroborate me we know the factwe know the fact repeated craggswhy so do i perhaps returned the client quietly what of that are you men of the world and did you never hear of a woman changing her mindthere certainly have been actions for breach said mr snitchey brought against both spinsters and widows but in the majority of cases cases interposed the client impatiently dont talk to me of cases the general precedent is in a much larger volume than any of your law books besides do you think i have lived six weeks in the doctors house for nothingi think sir observed mr snitchey gravely addressing himself to his partner that of all the scrapes mr wardens horses have brought him into at one time and another and they have been pretty numerous and pretty expensive as none know better than himself and you and i the worst scrape may turn out to be if he talks in this way this having ever been left by one of them at the doctors garden wall with three broken ribs a snapped collar bone and the lord knows how many bruises we didnt think so much of it at the time when we knew he was going on well under the doctors hands and roof but it looks bad now sir bad it looks very bad doctor jeddler too our client mr craggsmr alfred heathfield too a sort of client mr snitchey saidcraggsmr michael warden too a kind of client said the careless visitor and no bad one either having played the fool for ten or twelve years however mr michael warden has sown his wild oats now theres their crop in that box and he means to repent and be wise and in proof of it mr michael warden means if he can to marry marion the doctors lovely daughter and to carry her away with himreally mr craggs snitchey beganreally mr snitchey and mr craggs partners both said the client interrupting him you know your duty to your clients and you know well enough i am sure that it is no part of it to interfere in a mere love affair which i am obliged to confide to you i am not going to carry the young lady off without her own consent theres nothing illegal in it i never was mr heathfields bosom friend i violate no confidence of his i love where he loves and i mean to win where he would win if i canhe cant mr craggs said snitchey evidently anxious and discomfited he cant do it sir she dotes on mr alfreddoes she returned the clientmr craggs she dotes on him sir persisted snitcheyi didnt live six weeks some few months ago in the doctors house for nothing and i doubted that soon observed the client she would have doted on him if her sister could have brought it about but i watched them marion avoided his name avoided the subject shrunk from the least allusion to it with evident distresswhy should she mr craggs you know why should she sir inquired snitcheyi dont know why she should though there are many likely reasons said the client smiling at the attention and perplexity expressed in mr snitcheys shining eye and at his cautious way of carrying on the conversation and making himself informed upon the subject but i know she does she was very young when she made the engagement if it may be called one i am not even sure of that and has repented of it perhaps perhaps it seems a foppish thing to say but upon my soul i dont mean it in that light she may have fallen in love with me as i have fallen in love with herhe he mr alfred her old playfellow too you remember mr craggs said snitchey with a disconcerted laugh knew her almost from a babywhich makes it the more probable that she may be tired of his idea calmly pursued the client and not indisposed to exchange it for the newer one of another lover who presents himself or is presented by his horse under romantic circumstances has the not unfavourable reputation with a country girl of having lived thoughtlessly and gaily without doing much harm to anybody and who for his youth and figure and so forth this may seem foppish again but upon my soul i dont mean it in that light might perhaps pass muster in a crowd with mr alfred himselfthere was no gainsaying the last clause certainly and mr snitchey glancing at him thought so there was something naturally graceful and pleasant in the very carelessness of his air it seemed to suggest of his comely face and wellknit figure that they might be greatly better if he chose and that once roused and made earnest but he never had been earnest yet he could be full of fire and purpose a dangerous sort of libertine thought the shrewd lawyer to seem to catch the spark he wants from a young ladys eyesnow observe snitchey he continued rising and taking him by the button and craggs taking him by the button also and placing one partner on either side of him so that neither might evade him i dont ask you for any advice you are right to keep quite aloof from all parties in such a matter which is not one in which grave men like you could interfere on any side i am briefly going to review in halfadozen words my position and intention and then i shall leave it to you to do the best for me in money matters that you can seeing that if i run away with the doctors beautiful daughter as i hope to do and to become another man under her bright influence it will be for the moment more chargeable than running away alone but i shall soon make all that up in an altered lifei think it will be better not to hear this mr craggs saidsnitchey looking at him across the clienti think not said craggs both listened attentivelywell you neednt hear it replied their client ill mention it however i dont mean to ask the doctors consent because he wouldnt give it me but i mean to do the doctor no wrong or harm because besides there being nothing serious in such trifles as he says i hope to rescue his child my marion from what i see i know she dreads and contemplates with misery that is the return of this old lover if anything in the world is true it is true that she dreads his return nobody is injured so far i am so harried and worried here just now that i lead the life of a flyingfish i skulk about in the dark i am shut out of my own house and warned off my own grounds but that house and those grounds and many an acre besides will come back to me one day as you know and say and marion will probably be richer on your showing who are never sanguine ten years hence as my wife than as the wife of alfred heathfield whose return she dreads remember that and in whom or in any man my passion is not surpassed who is injured yet it is a fair case throughout my right is as good as his if she decide in my favour and i will try my right by her alone you will like to know no more after this and i will tell you no more now you know my purpose and wants when must i leave herein a week said snitchey mr craggsin something less i should say responded craggsin a month said the client after attentively watching the two faces this day month today is thursday succeed or fail on this day month i goits too long a delay said snitchey much too long but let it be so i thought hed have stipulated for three he murmured to himself are you going good night sirgood night returned the client shaking hands with the firmyoull live to see me making a good use of riches yet henceforth the star of my destiny is mariontake care of the stairs sir replied snitchey for she dont shine there good nightgood nightso they both stood at the stairhead with a pair of officecandles watching him down when he had gone away they stood looking at each otherwhat do you think of all this mr craggs said snitcheymr craggs shook his headit was our opinion on the day when that release was executed that there was something curious in the parting of that pair i recollect said snitcheyit was said mr craggsperhaps he deceives himself altogether pursued mr snitchey locking up the fireproof box and putting it away or if he dont a little bit of fickleness and perfidy is not a miracle mr craggs and yet i thought that pretty face was very true i thought said mr snitchey putting on his greatcoat for the weather was very cold drawing on his gloves and snuffing out one candle that i had even seen her character becoming stronger and more resolved of late more like her sistersmrs craggs was of the same opinion returned craggsid really give a trifle tonight observed mr snitchey who was a goodnatured man if i could believe that mr warden was reckoning without his host but lightheaded capricious and unballasted as he is he knows something of the world and its people he ought to for he has bought what he does know dear enough and i cant quite think that we had better not interfere we can do nothing mr craggs but keep quietnothing returned craggsour friend the doctor makes light of such things said mr snitchey shaking his head i hope he maynt stand in need of his philosophy our friend alfred talks of the battle of life he shook his head again i hope he maynt be cut down early in the day have you got your hat mr craggs i am going to put the other candle out mr craggs replying in the affirmative mr snitchey suited the action to the word and they groped their way out of the councilchamber now dark as the subject or the law in generalmy story passes to a quiet little study where on that same night the sisters and the hale old doctor sat by a cheerful fireside grace was working at her needle marion read aloud from a book before her the doctor in his dressinggown and slippers with his feet spread out upon the warm rug leaned back in his easy chair and listened to the book and looked upon his daughtersthey were very beautiful to look upon two better faces for a fireside never made a fireside bright and sacred something of the difference between them had been softened down in three years time and enthroned upon the clear brow of the younger sister looking through her eyes and thrilling in her voice was the same earnest nature that her own motherless youth had ripened in the elder sister long ago but she still appeared at once the lovelier and weaker of the two still seemed to rest her head upon her sisters breast and put her trust in her and look into her eyes for counsel and reliance those loving eyes so calm serene and cheerful as of oldand being in her own home read marion from the book her home made exquisitely dear by these remembrances she now began to know that the great trial of her heart must soon come on and could not be delayed o home our comforter and friend when others fall away to part with whom at any step between the cradle and the gravemarion my love said gracewhy puss exclaimed her father whats the mattershe put her hand upon the hand her sister stretched towards her and read on her voice still faltering and trembling though she made an effort to command it when thus interruptedto part with whom at any step between the cradle and the grave is always sorrowful o home so true to us so often slighted in return be lenient to them that turn away from thee and do not haunt their erring footsteps too reproachfully let no kind looks no wellremembered smiles be seen upon thy phantom face let no ray of affection welcome gentleness forbearance cordiality shine from thy white head let no old loving word or tone rise up in judgment against thy deserter but if thou canst look harshly and severely do in mercy to the penitentdear marion read no more tonight said grace for she was weepingi cannot she replied and closed the book the words seem all on firethe doctor was amused at this and laughed as he patted her on the headwhat overcome by a storybook said doctor jeddler print and paper well well its all one its as rational to make a serious matter of print and paper as of anything else but dry your eyes love dry your eyes i dare say the heroine has got home again long ago and made it up all round and if she hasnt a real home is only four walls and a fictitious one mere rags and ink whats the matter nowits only me mister said clemency putting in her head at the doorand whats the matter with you said the doctoroh bless you nothing ant the matter with me returned clemency and truly too to judge from her wellsoaped face in which there gleamed as usual the very soul of goodhumour which ungainly as she was made her quite engaging abrasions on the elbows are not generally understood it is true to range within that class of personal charms called beautyspots but it is better going through the world to have the arms chafed in that narrow passage than the temper and clemencys was sound and whole as any beautys in the landnothing ant the matter with me said clemency entering but come a little closer misterthe doctor in some astonishment complied with this invitationyou said i wasnt to give you one before them you know saidclemencya novice in the family might have supposed from her extraordinary ogling as she said it as well as from a singular rapture or ecstasy which pervaded her elbows as if she were embracing herself that one in its most favourable interpretation meant a chaste salute indeed the doctor himself seemed alarmed for the moment but quickly regained his composure as clemency having had recourse to both her pockets beginning with the right one going away to the wrong one and afterwards coming back to the right one again produced a letter from the postofficebritain was riding by on a errand she chuckled handing it to the doctor and see the mail come in and waited for it theres a h in the corner mr alfreds on his journey home i bet we shall have a wedding in the house there was two spoons in my saucer this morning oh luck how slow he opens itall this she delivered by way of soliloquy gradually rising higher and higher on tiptoe in her impatience to hear the news and making a corkscrew of her apron and a bottle of her mouth at last arriving at a climax of suspense and seeing the doctor still engaged in the perusal of the letter she came down flat upon the soles of her feet again and cast her apron as a veil over her head in a mute despair and inability to bear it any longerhere girls cried the doctor i cant help it i never could keep a secret in my life there are not many secrets indeed worth being kept in such a well never mind that alfreds coming home my dears directlydirectly exclaimed marionwhat the storybook is soon forgotten said the doctor pinching her cheek i thought the news would dry those tears yes let it be a surprise he says here but i cant let it be a surprise he must have a welcomedirectly repeated marionwhy perhaps not what your impatience calls directly returned the doctor but pretty soon too let us see let us see today is thursday is it not then he promises to be here this day monththis day month repeated marion softlya gay day and a holiday for us said the cheerful voice of her sister grace kissing her in congratulation long looked forward to dearest and come at lastshe answered with a smile a mournful smile but full of sisterly affection as she looked in her sisters face and listened to the quiet music of her voice picturing the happiness of this return her own face glowed with hope and joyand with a something else a something shining more and more through all the rest of its expression for which i have no name it was not exultation triumph proud enthusiasm they are not so calmly shown it was not love and gratitude alone though love and gratitude were part of it it emanated from no sordid thought for sordid thoughts do not light up the brow and hover on the lips and move the spirit like a fluttered light until the sympathetic figure tremblesdr jeddler in spite of his system of philosophy which he was continually contradicting and denying in practice but more famous philosophers have done that could not help having as much interest in the return of his old ward and pupil as if it had been a serious event so he sat himself down in his easychair again stretched out his slippered feet once more upon the rug read the letter over and over a great many times and talked it over more times stillah the day was said the doctor looking at the fire when you and he grace used to trot about arminarm in his holiday time like a couple of walking dolls you rememberi remember she answered with her pleasant laugh and plying her needle busilythis day month indeed mused the doctor that hardly seems a twelve month ago and where was my little marion thennever far from her sister said marion cheerily however little grace was everything to me even when she was a young child herselftrue puss true returned the doctor she was a staid little woman was grace and a wise housekeeper and a busy quiet pleasant body bearing with our humours and anticipating our wishes and always ready to forget her own even in those times i never knew you positive or obstinate grace my darling even then on any subject but onei am afraid i have changed sadly for the worse since laughedgrace still busy at her work what was that one fatheralfred of course said the doctor nothing would serve you but you must be called alfreds wife so we called you alfreds wife and you liked it better i believe odd as it seems now than being called a duchess if we could have made you oneindeed said grace placidlywhy dont you remember inquired the doctori think i remember something of it she returned but not much its so long ago and as she sat at work she hummed the burden of an old song which the doctor likedalfred will find a real wife soon she said breaking off and that will be a happy time indeed for all of us my three years trust is nearly at an end marion it has been a very easy one i shall tell alfred when i give you back to him that you have loved him dearly all the time and that he has never once needed my good services may i tell him so lovetell him dear grace replied marion that there never was a trust so generously nobly steadfastly discharged and that i have loved you all the time dearer and dearer every day and o how dearly nownay said her cheerful sister returning her embrace i can scarcely tell him that we will leave my deserts to alfreds imagination it will be liberal enough dear marion like your ownwith that she resumed the work she had for a moment laid down when her sister spoke so fervently and with it the old song the doctor liked to hear and the doctor still reposing in his easy chair with his slippered feet stretched out before him on the rug listened to the tune and beat time on his knee with alfreds letter and looked at his two daughters and thought that among the many trifles of the trifling world these trifles were agreeable enoughclemency newcome in the meantime having accomplished her mission and lingered in the room until she had made herself a party to the news descended to the kitchen where her coadjutor mr britain was regaling after supper surrounded by such a plentiful collection of bright potlids wellscoured saucepans burnished dinnercovers gleaming kettles and other tokens of her industrious habits arranged upon the walls and shelves that he sat as in the centre of a hall of mirrors the majority did not give forth very flattering portraits of him certainly nor were they by any means unanimous in their reflections as some made him very longfaced others very broadfaced some tolerably well looking others vastly illlooking according to their several manners of reflecting which were as various in respect of one fact as those of so many kinds of men but they all agreed that in the midst of them sat quite at his ease an individual with a pipe in his mouth and a jug of beer at his elbow who nodded condescendingly to clemency when she stationed herself at the same tablewell clemmy said britain how are you by this time and whats the newsclemency told him the news which he received very graciously a gracious change had come over benjamin from head to foot he was much broader much redder much more cheerful and much jollier in all respects it seemed as if his face had been tied up in a knot before and was now untwisted and smoothed outtherell be another job for snitchey and craggs i suppose he observed puffing slowly at his pipe more witnessing for you and me perhaps clemmylor replied his fair companion with her favourite twist of her favourite joints i wish it was me britainwish what was youagoing to be married said clemencybenjamin took his pipe out of his mouth and laughed heartily yes youre a likely subject for that he said poor clem clemency for her part laughed as heartily as he and seemed as much amused by the idea yes she assented im a likely subject for that ant iyoull never be married you know said mr britain resuming his pipedont you think i ever shall though said clemency in perfect good faithmr britain shook his head not a chance of itonly think said clemency well i suppose you mean tobritain one of these days dont youa question so abrupt upon a subject so momentous required consideration after blowing out a great cloud of smoke and looking at it with his head now on this side and now on that as if it were actually the question and he were surveying it in various aspects mr britain replied that he wasnt altogether clear about it but yees he thought he might come to that at lasti wish her joy whoever she may be cried clemencyoh shell have that said benjamin safe enoughbut she wouldnt have led quite such a joyful life as she will lead and wouldnt have had quite such a sociable sort of husband as she will have said clemency spreading herself half over the table and staring retrospectively at the candle if it hadnt been for not that i went to do it for it was accidental i am sure if it hadnt been for me now would she britaincertainly not returned mr britain by this time in that high state of appreciation of his pipe when a man can open his mouth but a very little way for speaking purposes and sitting luxuriously immovable in his chair can afford to turn only his eyes towards a companion and that very passively and gravely oh im greatly beholden to you you know clemlor how nice that is to think of said clemencyat the same time bringing her thoughts as well as her sight to bear upon the candlegrease and becoming abruptly reminiscent of its healing qualities as a balsam she anointed her left elbow with a plentiful application of that remedyyou see ive made a good many investigations of one sort and another in my time pursued mr britain with the profundity of a sage having been always of an inquiring turn of mind and ive read a good many books about the general rights of things and wrongs of things for i went into the literary line myself when i began lifedid you though cried the admiring clemencyyes said mr britain i was hid for the best part of two years behind a bookstall ready to fly out if anybody pocketed a volume and after that i was light porter to a stay and mantua maker in which capacity i was employed to carry about in oilskin baskets nothing but deceptions which soured my spirits and disturbed my confidence in human nature and after that i heard a world of discussions in this house which soured my spirits fresh and my opinion after all is that as a safe and comfortable sweetener of the same and as a pleasant guide through life theres nothing like a nutmeggraterclemency was about to offer a suggestion but he stopped her by anticipating itcombined he added gravely with a thimbledo as you wold you know and cetrer eh observed clemency folding her arms comfortably in her delight at this avowal and patting her elbows such a short cut ant itim not sure said mr britain that its what would be considered good philosophy ive my doubts about that but it wears well and saves a quantity of snarling which the genuine article dont alwayssee how you used to go on once yourself you know saidclemencyah said mr britain but the most extraordinary thing clemmy is that i should live to be brought round through you thats the strange part of it through you why i suppose you havent so much as half an idea in your headclemency without taking the least offence shook it and laughed and hugged herself and said no she didnt suppose she hadim pretty sure of it said mr britainoh i dare say youre right said clemency i dont pretend to none i dont want anybenjamin took his pipe from his lips and laughed till the tears ran down his face what a natural you are clemmy he said shaking his head with an infinite relish of the joke and wiping his eyes clemency without the smallest inclination to dispute it did the like and laughed as heartily as hei cant help liking you said mr britain youre a regular good creature in your way so shake hands clem whatever happens ill always take notice of you and be a friend to youwill you returned clemency well thats very good of youyes yes said mr britain giving her his pipe to knock the ashes out of it ill stand by you hark thats a curious noisenoise repeated clemencya footstep outside somebody dropping from the wall it sounded like said britain are they all abed upstairsyes all abed by this time she replieddidnt you hear anythingnothey both listened but heard nothingi tell you what said benjamin taking down a lantern ill have a look round before i go to bed myself for satisfactions sake undo the door while i light this clemmyclemency complied briskly but observed as she did so that he would only have his walk for his pains that it was all his fancy and so forth mr britain said very likely but sallied out nevertheless armed with the poker and casting the light of the lantern far and near in all directionsits as quiet as a churchyard said clemency looking after him and almost as ghostly tooglancing back into the kitchen she cried fearfully as a light figure stole into her view whats thathush said marion in an agitated whisper you have always loved me have you notloved you child you may be sure i havei am sure and i may trust you may i not there is no one else just now in whom i can trustyes said clemency with all her heartthere is some one out there pointing to the door whom i must see and speak with tonight michael warden for gods sake retire not nowclemency started with surprise and trouble as following the direction of the speakers eyes she saw a dark figure standing in the doorwayin another moment you may be discovered said marion not nowwait if you can in some concealment i will come presentlyhe waved his hand to her and was gone dont go to bed wait here for me said marion hurriedly i have been seeking to speak to you for an hour past oh be true to meeagerly seizing her bewildered hand and pressing it with both her own to her breast an action more expressive in its passion of entreaty than the most eloquent appeal in words marion withdrew as the light of the returning lantern flashed into the roomall still and peaceable nobody there fancy i suppose said mr britain as he locked and barred the door one of the effects of having a lively imagination halloa why whats the matterclemency who could not conceal the effects of her surprise and concern was sitting in a chair pale and trembling from head to footmatter she repeated chafing her hands and elbows nervously and looking anywhere but at him thats good in you britain that is after going and frightening one out of ones life with noises and lanterns and i dont know what all matter oh yesif youre frightened out of your life by a lantern clemmy said mr britain composedly blowing it out and hanging it up again that apparitions very soon got rid of but youre as bold as brass in general he said stopping to observe her and were after the noise and the lantern too what have you taken into your head not an idea ehbut as clemency bade him good night very much after her usual fashion and began to bustle about with a show of going to bed herself immediately little britain after giving utterance to the original remark that it was impossible to account for a womans whims bade her good night in return and taking up his candle strolled drowsily away to bedwhen all was quiet marion returnedopen the door she said and stand there close beside me whilei speak to him outsidetimid as her manner was it still evinced a resolute and settled purpose such as clemency could not resist she softly unbarred the door but before turning the key looked round on the young creature waiting to issue forth when she should open itthe face was not averted or cast down but looking full upon her in its pride of youth and beauty some simple sense of the slightness of the barrier that interposed itself between the happy home and honoured love of the fair girl and what might be the desolation of that home and shipwreck of its dearest treasure smote so keenly on the tender heart of clemency and so filled it to overflowing with sorrow and compassion that bursting into tears she threw her arms round marions neckits little that i know my dear cried clemency very little but i know that this should not be think of what you doi have thought of it many times said marion gentlyonce more urged clemency till tomorrow marion shook her headfor mr alfreds sake said clemency with homely earnestnesshim that you used to love so dearly onceshe hid her face upon the instant in her hands repeating once as if it rent her heartlet me go out said clemency soothing her ill tell him what you like dont cross the doorstep tonight im sure no good will come of it oh it was an unhappy day when mr warden was ever brought here think of your good father darling of your sisteri have said marion hastily raising her head you dont know what i do i must speak to him you are the best and truest friend in all the world for what you have said to me but i must take this step will you go with me clemency she kissed her on her friendly face or shall i go alonesorrowing and wondering clemency turned the key and opened the door into the dark and doubtful night that lay beyond the threshold marion passed quickly holding by her handin the dark night he joined her and they spoke together earnestly and long and the hand that held so fast by clemeneys now trembled now turned deadly cold now clasped and closed on hers in the strong feeling of the speech it emphasised unconsciously when they returned he followed to the door and pausing there a moment seized the other hand and pressed it to his lips then stealthily withdrewthe door was barred and locked again and once again she stood beneath her fathers roof not bowed down by the secret that she brought there though so young but with that same expression on her face for which i had no name before and shining through her tearsagain she thanked and thanked her humble friend and trusted to her as she said with confidence implicitly her chamber safely reached she fell upon her knees and with her secret weighing on her heart could praycould rise up from her prayers so tranquil and serene and bending over her fond sister in her slumber look upon her face and smile though sadly murmuring as she kissed her forehead how that grace had been a mother to her ever and she loved her as a childcould draw the passive arm about her neck when lying down to rest it seemed to cling there of its own will protectingly and tenderly even in sleep and breathe upon the parted lips god bless hercould sink into a peaceful sleep herself but for one dream in which she cried out in her innocent and touching voice that she was quite alone and they had all forgotten hera month soon passes even at its tardiest pace the month appointed to elapse between that night and the return was quick of foot and went by like a vapourthe day arrived a raging winter day that shook the old house sometimes as if it shivered in the blast a day to make home doubly home to give the chimneycorner new delights to shed a ruddier glow upon the faces gathered round the hearth and draw each fireside group into a closer and more social league against the roaring elements without such a wild winter day as best prepares the way for shutout night for curtained rooms and cheerful looks for music laughter dancing light and jovial entertainmentall these the doctor had in store to welcome alfred back they knew that he could not arrive till night and they would make the night air ring he said as he approached all his old friends should congregate about him he should not miss a face that he had known and liked no they should every one be thereso guests were bidden and musicians were engaged and tables spread and floors prepared for active feet and bountiful provision made of every hospitable kind because it was the christmas season and his eyes were all unused to english holly and its sturdy green the dancingroom was garlanded and hung with it and the red berries gleamed an english welcome to him peeping from among the leavesit was a busy day for all of them a busier day for none of them than grace who noiselessly presided everywhere and was the cheerful mind of all the preparations many a time that day as well as many a time within the fleeting month preceding it did clemency glance anxiously and almost fearfully at marion she saw her paler perhaps than usual but there was a sweet composure on her face that made it lovelier than everat night when she was dressed and wore upon her head a wreath that grace had proudly twined about it its mimic flowers were alfreds favourites as grace remembered when she chose them that old expression pensive almost sorrowful and yet so spiritual high and stirring sat again upon her brow enhanced a hundredfoldthe next wreath i adjust on this fair head will be a marriage wreath said grace or i am no true prophet dearher sister smiled and held her in her armsa moment grace dont leave me yet are you sure that i want nothing moreher care was not for that it was her sisters face she thought of and her eyes were fixed upon it tenderlymy art said grace can go no farther dear girl nor your beauty i never saw you look so beautiful as nowi never was so happy she returneday but there is a greater happiness in store in such another home as cheerful and as bright as this looks now said grace alfred and his young wife will soon be livingshe smiled again it is a happy home grace in your fancy i can see it in your eyes i know it will be happy dear how glad i am to know itwell cried the doctor bustling in here we are all ready for alfred eh he cant be here until pretty late an hour or so before midnight so therell be plenty of time for making merry before he comes hell not find us with the ice unbroken pile up the fire here britain let it shine upon the holly till it winks again its a world of nonsense puss true lovers and all the rest of it all nonsense but well be nonsensical with the rest of em and give our true lover a mad welcome upon my word said the old doctor looking at his daughters proudly im not clear tonight among other absurdities but that im the father of two handsome girlsall that one of them has ever done or may do may do dearest father to cause you pain or grief forgive her said marion forgive her now when her heart is full say that you forgive her that you will forgive her that she shall always share your love and and the rest was not said for her face was hidden on the old mans shouldertut tut tut said the doctor gently forgive what have i to forgive heyday if our true lovers come back to flurry us like this we must hold em at a distance we must send expresses out to stop em short upon the road and bring em on a mile or two a day until were properly prepared to meet em kiss me puss forgive why what a silly child you are if you had vexed and crossed me fifty times a day instead of not at all id forgive you everything but such a supplication kiss me again puss there prospective and retrospective a clear score between us pile up the fire here would you freeze the people on this bleak december night let us be light and warm and merry or ill not forgive some of youso gaily the old doctor carried it and the fire was piled up and the lights were bright and company arrived and a murmuring of lively tongues began and already there was a pleasant air of cheerful excitement stirring through all the housemore and more company came flocking in bright eyes sparkled upon marion smiling lips gave her joy of his return sage mothers fanned themselves and hoped she mightnt be too youthful and inconstant for the quiet round of home impetuous fathers fell into disgrace for too much exaltation of her beauty daughters envied her sons envied him innumerable pairs of lovers profited by the occasion all were interested animated and expectantmr and mrs craggs came arm in arm but mrs snitchey came alonewhy whats become of him inquired the doctorthe feather of a bird of paradise in mrs snitcheys turban trembled as if the bird of paradise were alive again when she said that doubtless mr craggs knew she was never toldthat nasty office said mrs craggsi wish it was burnt down said mrs snitcheyhes hes theres a little matter of business that keeps my partner rather late said mr craggs looking uneasily about himohh business dont tell me said mrs snitcheywe know what business means said mrs craggsbut their not knowing what it meant was perhaps the reason why mrs snitcheys bird of paradise feather quivered so portentously and why all the pendant bits on mrs craggss earrings shook like little bellsi wonder you could come away mr craggs said his wifemr craggs is fortunate im sure said mrs snitcheythat office so engrosses em said mrs craggsa person with an office has no business to be married at all said mrs snitcheythen mrs snitchey said within herself that that look of hers had pierced to craggss soul and he knew it and mrs craggs observed to craggs that his snitcheys were deceiving him behind his back and he would find it out when it was too latestill mr craggs without much heeding these remarks looked uneasily about until his eye rested on grace to whom he immediately presented himselfgood evening maam said craggs you look charmingly your miss your sister miss marion is she oh shes quite well mr craggsyes i is she here asked craggshere dont you see her yonder going to dance said gracemr craggs put on his spectacles to see the better looked at her through them for some time coughed and put them with an air of satisfaction in their sheath again and in his pocketnow the music struck up and the dance commenced the bright fire crackled and sparkled rose and fell as though it joined the dance itself in right good fellowship sometimes it roared as if it would make music too sometimes it flashed and beamed as if it were the eye of the old room it winked too sometimes like a knowing patriarch upon the youthful whisperers in corners sometimes it sported with the hollyboughs and shining on the leaves by fits and starts made them look as if they were in the cold winter night again and fluttering in the wind sometimes its genial humour grew obstreperous and passed all bounds and then it cast into the room among the twinkling feet with a loud burst a shower of harmless little sparks and in its exultation leaped and bounded like a mad thing up the broad old chimneyanother dance was near its close when mr snitchey touched his partner who was looking on upon the armmr craggs started as if his familiar had been a spectreis he gone he askedhush he has been with me said snitchey for three hours and more he went over everything he looked into all our arrangements for him and was very particular indeed he humphthe dance was finished marion passed close before him as he spoke she did not observe him or his partner but looked over her shoulder towards her sister in the distance as she slowly made her way into the crowd and passed out of their viewyou see all safe and well said mr craggs he didnt recur to that subject i supposenot a wordand is he really gone is he safe awayhe keeps to his word he drops down the river with the tide in that shell of a boat of his and so goes out to sea on this dark night a daredevil he is before the wind theres no such lonely road anywhere else thats one thing the tide flows he says an hour before midnight about this time im glad its over mr snitchey wiped his forehead which looked hot and anxiouswhat do you think said mr craggs about hush replied his cautious partner looking straight before him i understand you dont mention names and dont let us seem to be talking secrets i dont know what to think and to tell you the truth i dont care now its a great relief his selflove deceived him i suppose perhaps the young lady coquetted a little the evidence would seem to point that way alfred not arrivednot yet said mr craggs expected every minutegood mr snitchey wiped his forehead again its a great relief i havent been so nervous since weve been in partnership i intend to spend the evening now mr craggsmrs craggs and mrs snitchey joined them as he announced this intention the bird of paradise was in a state of extreme vibration and the little bells were ringing quite audiblyit has been the theme of general comment mr snitchey said mrssnitchey i hope the office is satisfiedsatisfied with what my dear asked mr snitcheywith the exposure of a defenceless woman to ridicule and remark returned his wife that is quite in the way of the office that isi really myself said mrs craggs have been so long accustomed to connect the office with everything opposed to domesticity that i am glad to know it as the avowed enemy of my peace there is something honest in that at all eventsmy dear urged mr craggs your good opinion is invaluable buti never avowed that the office was the enemy of your peaceno said mrs craggs ringing a perfect peal upon the little bells not you indeed you wouldnt be worthy of the office if you had the candour toas to my having been away tonight my dear said mr snitchey giving her his arm the deprivation has been mine im sure but as mr craggs knows mrs snitchey cut this reference very short by hitching her husband to a distance and asking him to look at that man to do her the favour to look at himat which man my dear said mr snitcheyyour chosen companion im no companion to you mr snitcheyyes yes you are my dear he interposedno no im not said mrs snitchey with a majestic smile i know my station will you look at your chosen companion mr snitchey at your referee at the keeper of your secrets at the man you trust at your other self in shortthe habitual association of self with craggs occasioned mrsnitchey to look in that directionif you can look that man in the eye this night said mrs snitchey and not know that you are deluded practised upon made the victim of his arts and bent down prostrate to his will by some unaccountable fascination which it is impossible to explain and against which no warning of mine is of the least avail all i can say is i pity youat the very same moment mrs craggs was oracular on the cross subject was it possible she said that craggs could so blind himself to his snitcheys as not to feel his true position did he mean to say that he had seen his snitcheys come into that room and didnt plainly see that there was reservation cunning treachery in the man would he tell her that his very action when he wiped his forehead and looked so stealthily about him didnt show that there was something weighing on the conscience of his precious snitcheys if he had a conscience that wouldnt bear the light did anybody but his snitcheys come to festive entertainments like a burglar which by the way was hardly a clear illustration of the case as he had walked in very mildly at the door and would he still assert to her at noonday it being nearly midnight that his snitcheys were to be justified through thick and thin against all facts and reason and experienceneither snitchey nor craggs openly attempted to stem the current which had thus set in but both were content to be carried gently along it until its force abated this happened at about the same time as a general movement for a country dance when mr snitchey proposed himself as a partner to mrs craggs and mr craggs gallantly offered himself to mrs snitchey and after some such slight evasions as why dont you ask somebody else and youll be glad i know if i decline and i wonder you can dance out of the office but this jocosely now each lady graciously accepted and took her placeit was an old custom among them indeed to do so and to pair off in like manner at dinners and suppers for they were excellent friends and on a footing of easy familiarity perhaps the false craggs and the wicked snitchey were a recognised fiction with the two wives as doe and roe incessantly running up and down bailiwicks were with the two husbands or perhaps the ladies had instituted and taken upon themselves these two shares in the business rather than be left out of it altogether but certain it is that each wife went as gravely and steadily to work in her vocation as her husband did in his and would have considered it almost impossible for the firm to maintain a successful and respectable existence without her laudable exertionsbut now the bird of paradise was seen to flutter down the middle and the little bells began to bounce and jingle in poussette and the doctors rosy face spun round and round like an expressive pegtop highly varnished and breathless mr craggs began to doubt already whether country dancing had been made too easy like the rest of life and mr snitchey with his nimble cuts and capers footed it for self and craggs and halfadozen morenow too the fire took fresh courage favoured by the lively wind the dance awakened and burnt clear and high it was the genius of the room and present everywhere it shone in peoples eyes it sparkled in the jewels on the snowy necks of girls it twinkled at their ears as if it whispered to them slyly it flashed about their waists it flickered on the ground and made it rosy for their feet it bloomed upon the ceiling that its glow might set off their bright faces and it kindled up a general illumination in mrs craggss little belfrynow too the lively air that fanned it grew less gentle as the music quickened and the dance proceeded with new spirit and a breeze arose that made the leaves and berries dance upon the wall as they had often done upon the trees and the breeze rustled in the room as if an invisible company of fairies treading in the footsteps of the good substantial revellers were whirling after them now too no feature of the doctors face could be distinguished as he spun and spun and now there seemed a dozen birds of paradise in fitful flight and now there were a thousand little bells at work and now a fleet of flying skirts was ruffled by a little tempest when the music gave in and the dance was overhot and breathless as the doctor was it only made him the more impatient for alfreds cominganything been seen britain anything been heardtoo dark to see far sir too much noise inside the house to hearthats right the gayer welcome for him how goes the timejust twelve sir he cant be long sirstir up the fire and throw another log upon it said the doctor let him see his welcome blazing out upon the night good boy as he comes alonghe saw it yes from the chaise he caught the light as he turned the corner by the old church he knew the room from which it shone he saw the wintry branches of the old trees between the light and him he knew that one of those trees rustled musically in the summer time at the window of marions chamberthe tears were in his eyes his heart throbbed so violently that he could hardly bear his happiness how often he had thought of this time pictured it under all circumstances feared that it might never come yearned and wearied for it far awayagain the light distinct and ruddy kindled he knew to give him welcome and to speed him home he beckoned with his hand and waved his hat and cheered out loud as if the light were they and they could see and hear him as he dashed towards them through the mud and mire triumphantlystop he knew the doctor and understood what he had done he would not let it be a surprise to them but he could make it one yet by going forward on foot if the orchardgate were open he could enter there if not the wall was easily climbed as he knew of old and he would be among them in an instanthe dismounted from the chaise and telling the driver even that was not easy in his agitation to remain behind for a few minutes and then to follow slowly ran on with exceeding swiftness tried the gate scaled the wall jumped down on the other side and stood panting in the old orchardthere was a frosty rime upon the trees which in the faint light of the clouded moon hung upon the smaller branches like dead garlands withered leaves crackled and snapped beneath his feet as he crept softly on towards the house the desolation of a winter night sat brooding on the earth and in the sky but the red light came cheerily towards him from the windows figures passed and repassed there and the hum and murmur of voices greeted his ear sweetlylistening for hers attempting as he crept on to detach it from the rest and half believing that he heard it he had nearly reached the door when it was abruptly opened and a figure coming out encountered his it instantly recoiled with a halfsuppressed cryclemency he said dont you know medont come in she answered pushing him back go away dont ask me why dont come inwhat is the matter he exclaimedi dont know i i am afraid to think go back harkthere was a sudden tumult in the house she put her hands upon her ears a wild scream such as no hands could shut out was heard and grace distraction in her looks and manner rushed out at the doorgrace he caught her in his arms what is it is she deadshe disengaged herself as if to recognise his face and fell down at his feeta crowd of figures came about them from the house among them was her father with a paper in his handwhat is it cried alfred grasping his hair with his hands and looking in an agony from face to face as he bent upon his knee beside the insensible girl will no one look at me will no one speak to me does no one know me is there no voice among you all to tell me what it isthere was a murmur among them she is gonegone he echoedfled my dear alfred said the doctor in a broken voice and with his hands before his face gone from her home and us to night she writes that she has made her innocent and blameless choice entreats that we will forgive her prays that we will not forget her and is gonewith whom wherehe started up as if to follow in pursuit but when they gave way to let him pass looked wildly round upon them staggered back and sunk down in his former attitude clasping one of graces cold hands in his ownthere was a hurried running to and fro confusion noise disorder and no purpose some proceeded to disperse themselves about the roads and some took horse and some got lights and some conversed together urging that there was no trace or track to follow some approached him kindly with the view of offering consolation some admonished him that grace must be removed into the house and that he prevented it he never heard them and he never movedthe snow fell fast and thick he looked up for a moment in the air and thought that those white ashes strewn upon his hopes and misery were suited to them well he looked round on the whitening ground and thought how marions footprints would be hushed and covered up as soon as made and even that

high bourgeoise or the petty nobility this family had inherited from the brothers paclet the fief of tirechappe which was dependent upon the bishop of paris and whose twentyone houses had been in the thirteenth century the object of so many suits before the official as possessor of this fief claude frollo was one of the twentyseven seigneurs keeping claim to a manor in fee in paris and its suburbs and for a long time his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality between the htel de tancarville belonging to master franois le rez and the college of tours in the records deposited at saint martin des champsclaude frollo had been destined from infancy by his parents to the ecclesiastical profession he had been taught to read in latin he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low while still a child his father had cloistered him in the college of torchi in the university there it was that he had grown up on the missal and the lexiconmoreover he was a sad grave serious child who studied ardently and learned quickly he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour mixed but little in the bacchanals of the rue du fouarre did not know what it was to dare alapas et capillos laniare and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463 which the annalists register gravely under the title of the sixth trouble of the university he seldom rallied the poor students of montaigu on the cappettes from which they derived their name or the bursars of the college of dormans on their shaved tonsure and their surtout particolored of bluishgreen blue and violet cloth azurini coloris et bruni as says the charter of the cardinal des quatrecouronneson the other hand he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the rue saint jean de beauvais the first pupil whom the abb de saint pierre de val at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law always perceived glued to a pillar of the school saintvendregesile opposite his rostrum was claude frollo armed with his horn inkbottle biting his pen scribbling on his threadbare knee and in winter blowing on his fingers the first auditor whom messire miles disliers doctor in decretals saw arrive every monday morning all breathless at the opening of the gates of the school of the chefsaintdenis was claude frollo thus at sixteen years of age the young clerk might have held his own in mystical theology against a father of the church in canonical theology against a father of the councils in scholastic theology against a doctor of sorbonnetheology conquered he had plunged into decretals from the master of sentences he had passed to the capitularies of charlemagne and he had devoured in succession in his appetite for science decretals upon decretals those of theodore bishop of hispalus those of bouchard bishop of worms those of yves bishop of chartres next the decretal of gratian which succeeded the capitularies of charlemagne then the collection of gregory ix then the epistle of superspecula of honorius iii he rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife with each other in the chaos of the middle agesa period which bishop theodore opens in 618 and which pope gregory closes in 1227decretals digested he flung himself upon medicine on the liberal arts he studied the science of herbs the science of unguents he became an expert in fevers and in contusions in sprains and abcesses jacques d espars would have received him as a physician richard hellain as a surgeon he also passed through all the degrees of licentiate master and doctor of arts he studied the languages latin greek hebrew a triple sanctuary then very little frequented his was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding in the matter of science at the age of eighteen he had made his way through the four faculties it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object learningit was towards this epoch that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of paris and among others as jean de troyes states master arnoul astrologer to the king who was a very fine man both wise and pleasant the rumor spread in the university that the rue tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady it was there that claudes parents resided in the midst of their fief the young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion when he entered it he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day a very young brother of his who was in swaddling clothes was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle this was all that remained to claude of his family the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood up to that moment he had lived only in science he now began to live in lifethis catastrophe was a crisis in claudes existence orphaned the eldest head of the family at the age of nineteen he felt himself rudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this world then moved with pity he was seized with passion and devotion towards that child his brother a sweet and strange thing was a human affection to him who had hitherto loved his books alonethis affection developed to a singular point in a soul so new it was like a first love separated since infancy from his parents whom he had hardly known cloistered and immured as it were in his books eager above all things to study and to learn exclusively attentive up to that time to his intelligence which broadened in science to his imagination which expanded in lettersthe poor scholar had not yet had time to feel the place of his heartthis young brother without mother or father this little child which had fallen abruptly from heaven into his arms made a new man of him he perceived that there was something else in the world besides the speculations of the sorbonne and the verses of homer that man needed affections that life without tenderness and without love was only a set of dry shrieking and rending wheels only he imagined for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existencehe threw himself therefore into the love for his little jehan with the passion of a character already profound ardent concentrated that poor frail creature pretty fairhaired rosy and curlythat orphan with another orphan for his only support touched him to the bottom of his heart and grave thinker as he was he set to meditating upon jehan with an infinite compassion he kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile and very worthy of care he was more than a brother to the child he became a mother to himlittle jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast claude gave him to a nurse besides the fief of tirechappe he had inherited from his father the fief of moulin which was a dependency of the square tower of gentilly it was a mill on a hill near the chteau of winchestre bictre there was a millers wife there who was nursing a fine child it was not far from the university and claude carried the little jehan to her in his own armsfrom that time forth feeling that he had a burden to bear he took life very seriously the thought of his little brother became not only his recreation but the object of his studies he resolved to consecrate himself entirely to a future for which he was responsible in the sight of god and never to have any other wife any other child than the happiness and fortune of his brother therefore he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession his merits his learning his quality of immediate vassal of the bishop of paris threw the doors of the church wide open to him at the age of twenty by special dispensation of the holy see he was a priest and served as the youngest of the chaplains of notredame the altar which is called because of the late mass which is said therealtare pigrorumthere plunged more deeply than ever in his dear books which he quitted only to run for an hour to the fief of moulin this mixture of learning and austerity so rare at his age had promptly acquired for him the respect and admiration of the monastery from the cloister his reputation as a learned man had passed to the people among whom it had changed a little a frequent occurrence at that time into reputation as a sorcererit was at the moment when he was returning on quasimodo day from saying his mass at the altar of the lazy which was by the side of the door leading to the nave on the right near the image of the virgin that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women chattering around the bed for foundlingsthen it was that he approached the unhappy little creature which was so hated and so menaced that distress that deformity that abandonment the thought of his young brother the idea which suddenly occurred to him that if he were to die his dear little jehan might also be flung miserably on the plank for foundlingsall this had gone to his heart simultaneously a great pity had moved in him and he had carried off the childwhen he removed the child from the sack he found it greatly deformed in very sooth the poor little wretch had a wart on his left eye his head placed directly on his shoulders his spinal column was crooked his breast bone prominent and his legs bowed but he appeared to be lively and although it was impossible to say in what language he lisped his cry indicated considerable force and health claudes compassion increased at the sight of this ugliness and he made a vow in his heart to rear the child for the love of his brother in order that whatever might be the future faults of the little jehan he should have beside him that charity done for his sake it was a sort of investment of good works which he was effecting in the name of his young brother it was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for him in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that coin the only sort which is received at the tollbar of paradisehe baptized his adopted child and gave him the name of quasimodo either because he desired thereby to mark the day when he had found him or because he wished to designate by that name to what a degree the poor little creature was incomplete and hardly sketched out in fact quasimodo blind hunchbacked knockkneed was

for that ungrateful man whose infidelity i am weak enough to lament but open not thy mouth i charge thee in his defenseno indeed madam said lucynor bring me any account of his tears his desperation or his despair said arabella since questionless he will feign them all to deceive mehere glanville who had watchd lucys coming and had followd her into ara bellas apartment appeard at the dooroh heavens cryd ara bella lifting up her fine eyes can it be that this disloyal man unawed by the discovery of his guilt again presumes to approach medearest cousin said glanville what is the meaning of all this how have i disobliged you what is my offence i beseech you tell meask the inconstant ariamenes replyd ara bella the offence of the ungrateful glanville the betrayer of cynecia can best answer that question to the deceiver of ara bella and the guilt of the one can only be compared to the crimes of the other this enigmatic way of speaking upon such occasions is of great use in the voluminous french romances since the doubt and confusion it is is the cause of both to the accused and accuser gives rise to a great number of succeeding mistakes and consequently adventuresgood god interrupted mr glanville fretting excessively what am i to understand by all this on my soul madam i dont know the meaning of one word you sayoh dissembler said ara bella is it thus that thou wouldst impose upon my credulity does not the name of ariamenes make thee tremble then and canst thou hear that of cynecia without confusiondear lady bella said glanville smiling what are these names to mefalse man interrupted ara bella dost thou presume to sport with thy crimes then are not the treacheries of ariamenes the crimes ofglanville could ariamenes be false to the princess of gaul and canglanville be innocent towards ara bellamr glanville who had never heard her in his opinion talk so ridiculously before was so amazed at the incomprehensible stuff she utterd with so much emotion that he began to fear her intellects were really touchd this thought gave him a concern that spread itself in a moment over his countenance he gazed on her with a fixd attention dreading yet wishing she would speak again equally divided between his hopes that her next speech would remove his suspicion and his fears that it might more confirm themara bella taking notice of his pensive posture turned away her head lest by beholding him she should relent and treat him with less severity than she had intended making at the same time a sign to him to be goneindeed lady bella said glanville who understood her perfectly well i cannot leave you in this temper i must know how i have been so unfortunate as to offend youara bella no longer able to contain herself burst into tears at this question with one hand she made repeated signs to him to be gone with the other she held her handkerchief to her eyes vexd and ashamed of her weaknessbut mr glanville excessively shocked at this sight instead of leaving her threw himself on his knees before her and taking her hand which he tenderly prest to his lipsgood god my dearest cousin said he how you distract me by this behavior sure something extraordinary must be the matter what can it be that thus afflicts you am i the cause of these tears can i have offended you so much speak dear madam let me know my crime yet may i perish if i am conscious of any towards youdisloyal man said ara bella disengaging her hand from his does then the crime of ariamenes seem so light in thy apprehension that thou canst hope to be thought innocent by ara bella no no ungrateful man the unfortunate cynecia shall have no cause to say that i will triumph in her spoils i myself will be the minister of her revenge and glanville shall suffer for the crime of ariameneswho the devil is this ariamenes cried glanville rising in a passion and why am i to suffer for his crime pray for heavens sake dear cousin dont let your imagination wander thus upon my soul i dont believe there is any such person as ariamenes in the worldvile equivocator said ara bella ariamenes tho dead to cynecia is alive to the deluded ara bella the crimes of ariamenes are the guilt of glanville and if the one has made himself unworthy of the princess of gaul by his perfidy and ingratitude the other by his baseness and deceit merits nothing but contempt and detestation from arabellafrenzy by my soul cryd glanville mutteringly between his teeth this is downright frenzy what shall i dohence from my presence resumed ara bella false and ungrateful man persecute me no more with the hateful offers of thy love from this moment i banish thee from my thoughts for ever and neither as glanville or as ariamenes will i ever behold thee morestay dear cousin said glanville holding her for she was endeavoring to rush by him unwilling he should see the tears that had overspread her face as she pronounced those words hear me i beg you but one word who is it you mean by ariamenes is it me tell me madam i beseech you this is some horrid mistake you have been imposed upon by some villainous artifice speak dear lady bellais it me you mean by ariamenes for so your last words seemd to hintara bella without regarding what he said struggled violently to force her hand from his and finding him still earnest to detain her told him with an enraged voice that she would call for help if he did not unhand her directlypoor glanville at this menace submissively dropt her hand and the moment she was free she flew out of the room and locking herself up in her closet sent her commands to him by one of her women whom she calld to her to leave her apartment immediately',\n",

interposing twixt the flower and what was oer it of such plenitude of flying shapes impede the sight and splendourbecause the light divine so penetrates the universe according to its merit that naught can be an obstacle against itthis realm secure and full of gladsomeness crowded with ancient people and with modern unto one mark had all its look and loveo trinal light that in a single star sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them look down upon our tempest here belowif the barbarians coming from some region that every day by helice is covered revolving with her son whom she delights inbeholding rome and all her noble works were wonderstruck what time the lateran above all mortal things was eminenti who to the divine had from the human from time unto eternity had come from florence to a people just and sanewith what amazement must i have been filled truly between this and the joy it was my pleasure not to hear and to be muteand as a pilgrim who delighteth him in gazing round the temple of his vow and hopes someday to retell how it wasso through the living light my way pursuing directed i mine eyes oer all the ranks now up now down and now all round aboutfaces i saw of charity persuasive embellished by his light and their own smile and attitudes adorned with every gracethe general form of paradise already my glance had comprehended as a whole in no part hitherto remaining fixedand round i turned me with rekindled wish my lady to interrogate of things concerning which my mind was in suspenseone thing i meant another answered me i thought i should see beatrice and saw an old man habited like the glorious peopleoerflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks with joy benign in attitude of pity as to a tender father is becomingand she where is she instantly i said whence he to put an end to thy desire me beatrice hath sent from mine own placeand if thou lookest up to the third round of the first rank again shalt thou behold her upon the throne her merits have assigned herwithout reply i lifted up mine eyes and saw her as she made herself a crown reflecting from herself the eternal raysnot from that region which the highest thunders is any mortal eye so far removed in whatsoever sea it deepest sinksas there from beatrice my sight but this was nothing unto me because her image descended not to me by medium blurredo lady thou in whom my hope is strong and who for my salvation didst endure in hell to leave the imprint of thy feetof whatsoever things i have beheld as coming from thy power and from thy goodness i recognise the virtue and the gracethou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom by all those ways by all the expedients whereby thou hadst the power of doing itpreserve towards me thy magnificence so that this soul of mine which thou hast healed pleasing to thee be loosened from the bodythus i implored and she so far away smiled as it seemed and looked once more at me then unto the eternal fountain turnedand said the old man holy that thou mayst accomplish perfectly thy journeying whereunto prayer and holy love have sent mefly with thine eyes all round about this garden for seeing it will discipline thy sight farther to mount along the ray divineand she the queen of heaven for whom i burn wholly with love will grant us every grace because that i her faithful bernard amas he who peradventure from croatia cometh to gaze at our veronica who through its ancient fame is never satedbut says in thought the while it is displayed my lord christ jesus god of very god now was your semblance made like unto thiseven such was i while gazing at the living charity of the man who in this world by contemplation tasted of that peacethou son of grace this jocund life began he will not be known to thee by keeping ever thine eyes below here on the lowest placebut mark the circles to the most remote until thou shalt behold enthroned the queen to whom this realm is subject and devotedi lifted up mine eyes and as at morn the oriental part of the horizon surpasses that wherein the sun goes downthus as if going with mine eyes from vale to mount i saw a part in the remoteness surpass in splendour all the other frontand even as there where we await the pole that phaeton drove badly blazes more the light and is on either side diminishedso likewise that pacific oriflamme gleamed brightest in the centre and each side in equal measure did the flame abateand at that centre with their wings expanded more than a thousand jubilant angels saw i each differing in effulgence and in kindi saw there at their sports and at their songs a beauty smiling which the gladness was within the eyes of all the other saintsand if i had in speaking as much wealth as in imagining i should not dare to attempt the smallest part of its delightbernard as soon as he beheld mine eyes fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour his own with such affection turned to herthat it made mine more ardent to behold',\n",

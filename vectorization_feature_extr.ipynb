I was a sketcher then:\\nSee here, my doing: curves of mountain, bridge,\\nBoat, island, ruins of a castle, built\\nWhen men knew how to build, upon a rock,\\nWith turrets lichen-gilded like a rock:\\nAnd here, new-comers in an ancient hold,\\nNew-comers from the Mersey, millionaires,\\nHere lived the Hills \\xad a Tudor-chimnied bulk\\nOf mellow brickwork on an isle of bowers.\\nO me, my pleasant rambles by the lake\\nWith Edwin Morris and with Edward Bull\\nThe curate; he was fatter than his cure.\\n\\nBut Edwin Morris, he that knew the names,\\nLong-learned names of agaric, moss and fern,\\nWho forged a thousand theories of the rocks,\\nWho taught me how to skate, to row, to swim,\\nWho read me rhymes elaborately good,\\nHis own \\xad I call\\'d him Crichton, for he seem\\'d\\nAll-perfect, finish\\'d to the finger nail.\\nAnd once I ask\\'d him of his early life,\\nAnd his first passion; and he answer\\'d me;\\nAnd well his words became him: was he not\\nA full-cell\\'d honeycomb of eloquence\\nStored from all flowers? Poet-like he spoke.\\n\"My love for Nature is as old as I;\\nBut thirty moons, one honeymoon to that,\\nAnd three rich sennights more, my love for her.\\nMy love for Nature and my love for her,\\nOf different ages, like twin-sisters grew,\\nTwin-sisters differently beautiful.\\nTo some full music rose and sank the sun,\\nAnd some full music seem\\'d to move and change\\nWith all the varied changes of the dark,\\nAnd either twilight and the day between;\\nFor daily hope fulfill\\'d, to rise again\\nRevolving toward fulfilment, made it sweet\\nTo walk, to sit, to sleep, to wake, to breathe.\"\\n\\nOr this or something like to this he spoke.\\nThen said the fat-faced curate Edward Bull,\\n\"I take it, God made the woman for the man,\\nAnd for the good and increase of the world,\\nA pretty face is well, and this is well,\\nTo have a dame indoors, that trims us up,\\nAnd keeps us tight; but these unreal ways\\nSeem but the theme of writers, and indeed\\nWorn threadbare. Man is made of solid stuff.\\nI say, God made the woman for the man,\\nAnd for the good and increase of the world.\"\\n\"Parson,\" said I, \"you pitch the pipe too low:\\nBut I have sudden touches, and can run\\nMy faith beyond my practice into his:\\nTho\\' if, in dancing after Letty Hill,\\nI do not hear the bells upon my cap,\\nI scarce hear  5  other music: yet say on.\\nWhat should one give to light on such a dream?\"\\nI ask\\'d him half-sardonically.\\n\"Give? Give all thou art,\" he answer\\'d, and a light\\nOf laughter dimpled in his swarthy cheek;\\n\"I would have hid her needle in my heart,\\nTo save her little finger from a scratch\\nNo deeper than the skin: my ears could hear\\nHer lightest breaths: her least remark was worth\\nThe experience of the wise. I went and came;\\nHer voice fled always thro\\' the summer land;\\nI spoke her name alone. Thrice-happy days!\\nThe flower of each, those moments when we met,\\nThe crown of all, we met to part no more.\"\\n\\nWere not his words delicious, I a beast\\nTo take them as I did? but something jarr\\'d;\\nWhether he spoke too largely; that there seem\\'d\\nA touch of something false, some self-conceit,\\nOr over-smoothness: howsoe\\'er it was,\\nHe scarcely hit my humour, and I said: \\xad\\n\"Friend Edwin, do not think yourself alone\\nOf all men happy. Shall not Love to me,\\nAs in the Latin song I learnt at school,\\nSneeze out a full God-bless-you right and left?\\nBut you can talk: yours is a kindly vein:\\nI have I think \\xad Heaven knows \\xad as much within;\\nHave or should have, but for a thought or two,\\nThat like a purple beech  among the greens\\nLooks out of place: \\'tis from no want in her:\\nIt is my shyness, or my self-distrust,\\nOr something of a wayward modern mind\\nDissecting passion. Time will set me right.\"\\n\\nSo spoke I knowing not the things that were.\\nThen said the fat-faced curate, Edward Bull:\\n\"God made the woman for the use of man,\\nAnd for the good and increase of the world\".\\nAnd I and Edwin laugh\\'d; and now we paused\\nAbout the windings of the marge to hear\\nThe soft wind blowing over meadowy holms\\nAnd alders, garden-isles  ; and now we left\\nThe clerk behind us, I and he, and ran\\nBy ripply shallows of the lisping lake,\\nDelighted with the freshness and the sound.\\nBut, when the bracken rusted on their crags,\\nMy suit had wither\\'d, nipt to death by him\\nThat was a God, and is a lawyer\\'s clerk,\\nThe rentroll Cupid of our rainy isles.\\n\\n\\' Tis true, we met; one hour I had, no more:\\nShe sent a note, the seal an Elle vous suit,\\nThe close \"Your Letty, only yours\"; and this\\nThrice underscored. The friendly mist of morn\\nClung to the lake. I boated over, ran\\nMy craft aground, and heard with beating heart\\nThe Sweet-Gale rustle round the shelving keel;\\nAnd out I stept, and up I crept: she moved,\\nLike Proserpine in Enna, gathering flowers:\\nThen low and sweet I whistled thrice; and she,\\nShe turn\\'d, we closed, we kiss\\'d, swore faith, I breathed\\nIn some new planet: a silent cousin stole\\nUpon us and departed: \"Leave,\" she cried,\\n\"O leave me!\" \"Never, dearest, never: here\\nI brave the worst:\" and while we stood like fools\\nEmbracing, all at once a score of pugs\\nAnd poodles yell\\'d within, and out they came\\nTrustees and Aunts and Uncles. \"What, with him!\\n\"Go\" (shrill\\'d the cottonspinning chorus) \"him!\"\\nI choked. Again they shriek\\'d the burthen \"Him!\"\\nAgain with hands of wild rejection \"Go! \\xad\\nGirl, get you in!\" She went \\xad and in one month\\nThey wedded her to sixty thousand pounds,\\nTo lands in Kent and messuages in York,\\nAnd slight Sir Robert with his watery smile\\nAnd educated whisker. But for me,\\nThey set an ancient creditor to work:\\nIt seems I broke a close with force and arms:\\nThere came a mystic token from the king\\nTo greet the sheriff, needless courtesy!\\nI read, and fled by night, and flying turn\\'d:\\nHer taper glimmer\\'d in the lake below:\\nI turn\\'d once more, close-button\\'d to the storm;\\nSo left the place,    left Edwin, nor have seen\\nHim since, nor heard of her, nor cared to hear.\\nNor cared to hear? perhaps; yet long ago\\nI have pardon\\'d little Letty; not indeed,\\nIt may be, for her own dear sake but this,\\nShe seems a part of those fresh days to me;\\nFor in the dust and drouth of London life\\nShe moves among my visions of the lake,\\nWhile the prime swallow dips his wing, or then\\nWhile the gold-lily blows, and overhead\\nThe light cloud smoulders on the summer crag.',\n",

He had ceased to wonder at her long black hair and finger it.Six months back he had told her, “If Ah kin haul de wood heah and chop it fuh yuh, look lak you oughta be able tuh tote it inside. Mah fust wife never bothered me ’bout choppin’ no wood nohow. She’d grab dat ax and sling chips lak uh man. You done been spoilt rotten.”\\n\\nSo Janie had told him, “Ah’m just as stiff as you is stout. If you can stand not to chop and tote wood Ah reckon you can stand not to git no dinner. ’Scuse mah freezolity, Mist’ Killicks, but Ah don’t mean to chop de first chip.”\\n\\n“Aw you know Ah’m gwine chop de wood fuh yuh. Even if you is stingy as you can be wid me. Yo’ Grandma and me myself done spoilt yuh now, and Ah reckon Ah have tuh keep on wid it.”\\n\\nOne morning soon he called her out of the kitchen to the barn. He had the mule all saddled at the gate.\\n\\n“Looka heah, LilBit, help me out some. Cut up dese seed taters fuh me. Ah got tuh go step off a piece.”\\n\\n“Where you goin’?”\\n\\n“Over tuh Lake City tuh see uh man about uh mule.”\\n\\n“Whut you need two mules fuh? Lessen you aims to swap off dis one.”\\n\\n“Naw, Ah needs two mules dis yeah. Taters is goin’ tuh be taters in de fall. Bringin’ big prices. Ah aims tuh run two plows, and dis man Ah’m talkin’ ’bout is got uh mule all gentled up so even uh woman kin handle ’im.”\\n\\nLogan held his wad of tobacco real still in his jaw like a thermometer of his feelings while he studied Janie’s face and waited for her to say something.\\n\\n“So Ah thought Ah mout as well go see.” He tagged on and swallowed to kill time but Janie said nothing except, “Ah’ll cut de p’taters fuh yuh. When yuh comin’ back?”\\n“Don’t know exactly. Round dust dark Ah reckon. It’s uh sorta long trip—specially if Ah hafter lead one on de way back.”\\n\\nWhen Janie had finished indoors she sat down in the barn with the potatoes. But springtime reached her in there so she moved everything to a place in the yard where she could see the road. The noon sun filtered through the leaves of the fine oak tree where she sat and made lacy patterns on the ground. She had been there a long time when she heard whistling coming down the road.\\n\\nIt was a cityfied, stylish dressed man with his hat set at an angle that didn’t belong in these parts. His coat was over his arm, but he didn’t need it to represent his clothes. The shirt with the silk sleeveholders was dazzling enough for the world. He whistled, mopped his face and walked like he knew where he was going. He was a seal-brown color but he acted like Mr. Washburn or somebody like that to Janie. Where would such a man be coming from and where was he going? He didn’t look her way nor no other way except straight ahead, so Janie ran to the pump and jerked the handle hard while she pumped. It made a loud noise and also made her heavy hair fall down. So he stopped and looked hard, and then he asked her for a cool drink of water.\\n\\nJanie pumped it off until she got a good look at the man. He talked friendly while he drank.\\n\\nJoe Starks was the name, yeah Joe Starks from in and through Georgy. Been workin’ for white folks all his life. Saved up some money—round three hundred dollars, yes indeed, right here in his pocket. Kept hearin’ ’bout them buildin’ a new state down heah in Floridy and sort of wanted to come. But he was makin’ money where he was. But when he heard all about ’em makin’ a town all outa colored folks, he knowed dat was de place he wanted to be. He had always wanted to be a big voice, but de white folks had all de sayso where he come from and everywhere else, exceptin’ dis place dat colored folks was buildin’ theirselves. Dat was right too. De man dat built things oughta boss it. Let colored folks build things too if dey wants to crow over somethin’. He was glad he had his money all saved up. He meant to git dere whilst de town wuz yet a baby. He meant to buy in big. It had always been his wish and desire to be a big voice and he had to live nearly thirty years to find a chance. Where was Janie’s papa and mama?\\n\\n“Dey dead, Ah reckon. Ah wouldn’t know ’bout ’em ’cause mah Grandma raised me. She dead too.”\\n\\n“She dead too! Well, who’s lookin’ after a lil girl-chile lak you?”\\n\\n“Ah’m married.”\\n\\n“You married? You ain’t hardly old enough to be weaned. Ah betcha you still craves sugar-tits, doncher?”\\n\\n“Yeah, and Ah makes and sucks ’em when de notion strikes me. Drinks sweeten’ water too.”\\n\\n“Ah loves dat mahself. Never specks to get too old to enjoy syrup sweeten’ water when it’s cools and nice.”\\n\\n“Us got plenty syrup in de barn. Ribbon-cane syrup. If you so desires—”\\n\\n“Where yo’ husband at, Mis’ er-er.”\\n“Mah name is Janie Mae Killicks since Ah got married. Useter be name Janie Mae Crawford. Mah husband is gone tuh buy a mule fuh me tuh plow. He left me cuttin’ up seed p’taters.”\\n\\n“You behind a plow! You ain’t got no mo’ business wid uh plow than uh hog is got wid uh holiday! You ain’t got no business cuttin’ up no seed p’taters neither. A pretty doll-baby lak you is made to sit on de front porch and rock and fan yo’self and eat p’taters dat other folks plant just special for you.”\\n\\nJanie laughed and drew two quarts of syrup from the barrel and Joe Starks pumped the water bucket full of cool water. They sat under the tree and talked. He was going on down to the new part of Florida, but no harm to stop and chat. He later decided he needed a rest anyway. It would do him good to rest a week or two.\\n\\nEvery day after that they managed to meet in the scrub oaks across the road and talk about when he would be a big ruler of things with her reaping the benefits. Janie pulled back a long time because he did not represent sun-up and pollen and blooming trees, but he spoke for far horizon. He spoke for change and chance. Still she hung back. The memory of Nanny was still powerful and strong.\\n\\n“Janie, if you think Ah aims to tole you off and make a dog outa you, youse wrong. Ah wants to make a wife outa you.”\\n\\n“You mean dat, Joe?”\\n\\n“De day you puts yo’ hand in mine, Ah wouldn’t let de sun go down on us single. Ah’m uh man wid principles. You ain’t never knowed what it was to be treated lak a lady and Ah wants to be de one tuh show yuh. Call me Jody lak you do sometime.”\\n\\n“Jody,” she smiled up at him, “but s’posin’—”\\n\\n“Leave de s’posin’ and everything else to me. Ah’ll be down dis road uh little after sunup tomorrow mornin’ to wait for you. You come go wid me. Den all de rest of yo’ natural life you kin live lak you oughta. Kiss me and shake yo’ head. When you do dat, yo’ plentiful hair breaks lak day.”\\n\\nJanie debated the matter that night in bed.\\n\\n“Logan, you ’sleep?”\\n\\n“If Ah wuz, you’d be done woke me up callin’ me.”\\n\\n“Ah wuz thinkin’ real hard about us; about you and me.”\\n“It’s about time. Youse powerful independent around here sometime considerin’.”\\n\\n“Considerin’ whut for instance?”\\n\\n“Considerin’ youse born in a carriage ’thout no top to it, and yo’ mama and you bein’ born and raised in de white folks back-yard.”\\n\\n“You didn’t say all dat when you wuz begging Nanny for me to marry you.”\\n\\n“Ah thought you would ’preciate good treatment. Thought Ah’d take and make somethin’ outa yuh. You think youse white folks by de way you act.”\\n\\n“S’posin’ Ah wuz to run off and leave yuh sometime.”\\n\\nThere! Janie had put words in his held-in fears. She might run off sure enough. The thought put a terrible ache in Logan’s body, but he thought it best to put on scorn.\\n\\n“Ah’m gettin’ sleepy, Janie. Let’s don’t talk no mo’. ’Tain’t too many mens would trust yuh, knowin’ yo’ folks lak dey do.”\\n\\n“Ah might take and find somebody dat did trust me and leave yuh.”\\n\\n“Shucks! ’Tain’t no mo’ fools lak me. A whole lot of mens will grin in yo’ face, but dey ain’t gwine tuh work and feed yuh. You won’t git far and you won’t be long, when dat big gut reach over and grab dat little one, you’ll be too glad to come back here.”\\n\\n“You don’t take nothin’ to count but sow-belly and cornbread.”\\n\\n“Ah’m sleepy. Ah don’t aim to worry mah gut into a fiddle-string wid no s’posin’.” He flopped over resentful in his agony and pretended sleep. He hoped that he had hurt her as she had hurt him.\\n\\nJanie got up with him the next morning and had the breakfast halfway done when he bellowed from the barn.\\n\\n“Janie!” Logan called harshly. “Come help me move dis manure pile befo’ de sun gits hot. You don’t take a bit of interest in dis place. ’Tain’t no use in foolin’ round in dat kitchen all day long.”\\n\\nJanie walked to the door with the pan in her hand still stirring the cornmeal dough and looked towards the barn. The sun from ambush was threatening the world with red daggers, but the shadows were gray and solid-looking around the barn. Logan with his shovel looked like a black bear doing some clumsy dance on his hind legs.\\n\\n“You don’t need mah help out dere, Logan. Youse in yo’ place and Ah’m in mine.”\\n\\n“You ain’t got no particular place. It’s wherever Ah need yuh. Git uh move on yuh, and dat quick.”\\n\\n“Mah mamma didn’t tell me Ah wuz born in no hurry. So whut business Ah got rushin’ now? Anyhow dat ain’t whut youse mad about. Youse mad ’cause Ah don’t fall down and wash-up dese sixty acres uh ground yuh got. You ain’t done me no favor by marryin’ me. And if dat’s what you call yo’self doin’, Ah don’t thank yuh for it. Youse mad ’cause Ah’m tellin’ yuh whut you already knowed.”\\n\\nLogan dropped his shovel and made two or three clumsy steps towards the house, then stopped abruptly.\\n\\n“Don’t you change too many words wid me dis mawnin’, Janie, do Ah’ll take and change ends wid yuh! Heah, Ah just as good as take you out de white folks’ kitchen and set you down on yo’ royal diasticutis and you take and low-rate me! Ah’ll take holt uh dat ax and come in dere and kill yuh! You better dry up in dere! Ah’m too honest and hard-workin’ for anybody in yo’ family, dat’s de reason you don’t want me!” The last sentence was half a sob and half a cry. “Ah guess some low-lifed nigger is grinnin’ in yo’ face and lyin’ tuh yuh. God damn yo’ hide!”\\n\\nJanie turned from the door without answering, and stood still in the middle of the floor without knowing it. She turned wrongside out just standing there and feeling. When the throbbing calmed a little she gave Logan’s speech a hard thought and placed it beside other things she had seen and heard. When she had finished with that she dumped the dough on the skillet and smoothed it over with her hand. She wasn’t even angry. Logan was accusing her of her mamma, her grandmama and her feelings, and she couldn’t do a thing about any of it. The sow-belly in the pan needed turning. She flipped it over and shoved it back. A little cold water in the coffee pot to settle it. Turned the ho-cake with a plate and then made a little laugh. What was she losing so much time for? A feeling of sudden newness and change came over her. Janie hurried out of the front gate and turned south. Even if Joe was not there waiting for her, the change was bound to do her good.\\n\\nThe morning road air was like a new dress. That made her feel the apron tied around her waist. She untied it and flung it on a low bush beside the road and walked on, picking flowers and making a bouquet. After that she came to where Joe Starks was waiting for her with a hired rig. He was very solemn and helped her to the seat beside him. With him on it, it sat like some high, ruling chair. From now on until death she was going to have flower dust and springtime sprinkled over everything. A bee for her bloom. Her old thoughts were going to come in handy now, but new words would have to be made and said to fit them.\\n\\n“Green Cove Springs,” he told the driver. So they were married there before sundown, just like Joe had said. With new clothes of silk and wool.\\n\\nThey sat on the boarding house porch and saw the sun plunge into the same crack in the earth from which the night emerged.',\n",

       " 'The Late Trial At Cologne\\n\\nDecember 22, 1852.\\nYou will have ere this received by the European papers numerous reports of the Communist Monster Trial at Cologne, Prussia, and of its result. But as none of the reports is anything like a faithful statement of the facts, and as these facts throw a glaring light upon the political means by which the continent of Europe is kept in bondage, I consider it necessary to revert to this trial.\\n\\nThe Communist or Proletarian party, as well as other parties, had lost, by suppression of the rights of association and meeting, the means of giving to itself a legal organization on the Continent. Its leaders, besides, had been exiled from their countries. But no political party can exist without an organization; and that organization which both the Liberal bourgeois and the Democratic shopkeeping class were enabled more or less to supply by the social station, advantages, and long-established, every-day intercourse of their members, the proletarian class, without such social station and pecuniary means, was necessarily compelled to seek in secret association. Hence, both in France and Germany, sprung up those numerous secret Societies which have, ever since 1849, one after another, been discovered by the police, and prosecuted as conspiracies; but if many of them were really conspiracies, formed with the actual intention of upsetting the Government for the time being,—and he is a coward that under certain circumstances would not conspire, just as he is a fool who, under other circumstances, would do so;—there were some other Societies which were formed with a wider and more elevated purpose, which knew that the upsetting of an existing Government was but a passing stage in the great impending struggle, and which intended to keep together and to prepare the party, whose nucleus they formed, for the last decisive combat which must, one day or another, crush forever in Europe the domination, not of mere “tyrants,” “despots” and “usurpers,” but of a power far superior, and far more formidable than theirs; that of capital over labor.\\n\\nThe organization of the advanced Communist party in Germany was of this kind. In accordance with the principles of the “Manifesto”[11] (published in 1848), and with those explained in the series of articles on “Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany,” published in the New York Daily Tribune, this party never imagined itself capable of producing, at any time and at its pleasure, that revolution which was to carry its ideas into practice. It studied the causes that had produced the revolutionary movement in 1848, and the causes that made them fail. Recognizing the social antagonism of classes at the bottom of all political struggles, it applied itself to the study of the conditions under which one class of society can and must be called on to represent the whole of the interests of a nation, and thus politically to rule over it. History showed to the Communist party how, after the landed aristocracy of the Middle Ages, the monied power of the first capitalists arose and seized the reins of Government; how the social influence and political rule of this financial section of capitalists was superseded by the rising strength since the introduction of steam, of the manufacturing capitalists, and how at the present moment two more classes claim their turn of domination, the petty trading class and the industrial working class. The practical revolutionary experience of 1848-1849 confirmed the reasonings of theory, which led to the conclusion that the Democracy of the petty traders must first have its turn, before the Communist working class could hope to permanently establish itself in power and destroy that system of wage-slavery which keeps it under the yoke of the bourgeoisie. Thus the secret organization of the Communists could not have the direct purpose of upsetting the present Governments of Germany. Being formed to upset not these, but the insurrectionary Government, which is sooner or later to follow them, its members might, and certainly would, individually, lend an active hand to a revolutionary movement against the present status quo in its turn; but the preparation of such a movement, otherwise than by spreading of Communist opinions by the masses, could not be an object of the Association. So well was this foundation of the Society understood by the majority of its members, that when the place-hunting ambition of some tried to turn it into a conspiracy for making an extempore revolution they were speedily turned out.\\n\\nNow, according to no law upon the face of the earth, could such an Association be called a plot, a conspiracy for purposes of high treason. If it was a conspiracy, it was one against, not the existing Government, but its probable successor. And the Prussian Government was aware of it. That was the cause why the eleven defendants were kept in solitary confinement during eighteen months, spent, on the part of the authorities, in the strangest judicial feats. Imagine, that after eight months\\' detention, the prisoners were remanded for some months more, “there being no evidence of any crime against them!” And when at last they were brought before a jury, there was not a single overt act of a treasonable nature proved against them. And yet they were convicted, and you will speedily see how.\\n\\nOne of the emissaries of the society was arrested in May, 1851, and from documents found upon him, other arrests followed. A Prussian police officer, a certain Stieber, was immediately ordered to trace the ramifications, in London, of the pretended plot. He succeeded in obtaining some papers connected with the above-mentioned seceders from the society, who had, after being turned out, formed an actual conspiracy in Paris and London. These papers were obtained by a double crime. A man named Reuter was bribed to break open the writing-desk of the secretary of the Society, and steal the papers therefrom. But that was nothing yet. This theft led to the discovery and conviction of the so-called Franco-German plot, in Paris, but it gave no clue as to the great Communist Association. The Paris plot, we may as well here observe, was under the direction of a few ambitious imbeciles and political chevaliers d\\'industrie in London, and of a formerly convicted forger, then acting as a police spy in Paris; their dupes made up, by rabid declamations and blood-thirsty rantings, for the utter insignificance of their political existence.\\n\\nThe Prussian police, then, had to look out for fresh discoveries. They established a regular office of secret police at the Prussian Embassy in London. A police agent, Greif by name, held his odious vocation under the title of an attaché to the Embassy—a step which should suffice to put all Prussian embassies out of the pale of international law, and which even the Austrians have not yet dared to take. Under him worked a certain Fleury, a merchant in the city of London, a man of some fortune and rather respectably connected, one of those low creatures who do the basest actions from an innate inclination to infamy. Another agent was a commercial clerk named Hirsch, who, however, had already been denounced as a spy on his arrival. He introduced himself into the society of some German Communist refugees in London, and they, in order to obtain proofs of his real character, admitted him for a short time. The proofs of his connection with the police were very soon obtained, and Herr Hirsch, from that time, absented himself. Although, however, he thus resigned all opportunities of gaining the information he was paid to procure, he was not inactive. From his retreat in Kensington, where he never met one of the Communists in question, he manufactured every week pretended reports of pretended sittings of a pretended Central Committee of that very conspiracy which the Prussian police could not get hold of. The contents of these reports were of the most absurd nature; not a Christian name was correct, not a name correctly spelt, not a single individual made to speak as he would be likely to speak. His master, Fleury, assisted him in this forgery, and it is not yet proved that “Attaché” Greif can wash his hands of these infamous proceedings. The Prussian Government, incredible to say, took these silly fabrications for gospel truth, and you may imagine what a confusion such depositions created in the evidence brought before the jury. When the trial came on, Herr Stieber, the already mentioned police officer, got into the witness-box, swore to all these absurdities, and, with no little self-complacency, maintained that he had a secret agent in the very closest intimacy with those parties in London who were considered the prime movers in this awful conspiracy. This secret agent was very secret indeed, for he had hid his face for eight months in Kensington, for fear he might actually see one of the parties whose most secret thoughts, words and doings, he pretended to report week after week.\\n\\nMessrs. Hirsch and Fleury, however, had another invention in store. They worked up the whole of the reports they had made into an “original minute book” of the sittings of the Secret Supreme Committee, whose existence was maintained by the Prussian police; and Herr Stieber, finding that this book wondrously agreed with the reports already received from the same parties, at once laid it before the jury, declaring upon his oath that after serious examination, and according to his fullest conviction, that book was genuine. It was then that most of the absurdities reported by Hirsch were made public. You may imagine the surprise of the pretended members of that Secret Committee when they found things stated of them which they never knew before. Some who were baptized William were here christened Louis or Charles; others, at the time they were at the other end of England, were made to have pronounced speeches in London; others were reported to have read letters they never had received; they were made to have met regularly on a Thursday, when they used to have a convivial reunion, once a week, on Wednesdays; a working man, who could hardly write, figured as one of the takers of minutes, and signed as such; and they all of them were made to speak in a language which, if it may be that of Prussian police stations, was certainly not that of a reunion in which literary men, favorably known in their country, formed the majority. And, to crown the whole, a receipt was forged for a sum of money, pretended to have been paid by the fabricators to the pretended secretary of the fictitious Central Committee for this book; but the existence of this pretended secretary rested merely upon a hoax that some malicious Communist had played upon the unfortunate Hirsch.\\n\\nThis clumsy fabrication was too scandalous an affair not to produce the contrary of its intended effect. Although the London friends of the defendants were deprived of all means to bring the facts of the case before the jury—although the letters they sent to the counsel for the defence were suppressed by the post—although the documents and affidavits they succeeded in getting into the hands of these legal gentlemen were not admitted in evidence, yet the general indignation was such that even the public accusers, nay, even Herr Stieber—whose oath had been given as a guarantee for the authenticity of that book—were compelled to recognize it as a forgery.\\n\\nThis forgery, however, was not the only thing of the kind of which the police was guilty. Two or three more cases of the sort came out during the trial. The documents stolen by Reuter were interpolated by the police so as to disfigure their meaning. A paper, containing some rabid nonsense, was written in a handwriting imitating that of Dr. Marx, and for a time it was pretended that it had been written by him, until at last the prosecution was obliged to acknowledge the forgery. But for every police infamy that was proved as such, there were five or six fresh ones brought forward, which could not, at the moment, be unveiled, the defence being taken by surprise, the proofs having to be got from London, and every correspondence of the counsel for the defence with the London Communist refugees being in open court treated as complicity in the alleged plot!\\nThat Greif and Fleury are what they are here represented to be has been stated by Herr Stieber himself, in his evidence; as to Hirsch, he has before a London magistrate confessed that he forged the “minute book,” by order and with the assistance of Fleury, and then made his escape from this country in order to evade a criminal prosecution.\\n\\nThe Government could stand few such branding disclosures as came to light during the trial. It had a jury—six nobles, two Government officials. These were not the men to look closely into the confused mass of evidence heaped before them during six weeks, when they heard it continually dinned into their ears that the defendants were the chiefs of a dreadful Communist conspiracy, got up in order to subvert everything sacred—property, family, religion, order, government and law! And yet, had not the Government, at the same time, brought it to the knowledge of the privileged classes, that an acquittal in this trial would be the signal for the suppression of the jury; and that it would be taken as a direct political demonstration—as a proof of the middle-class Liberal Opposition being ready to unite even with the most extreme revolutionists—the verdict would have been an acquittal. As it was, the retroactive application of the new Prussian code enabled the Government to have seven prisoners convicted, while four merely were acquitted, and those convicted were sentenced to imprisonment varying from three to six years, as you have, doubtless, already stated at the time the news reached you.\\n\\nLondon, December 1, 1852.\\n\\nFootnotes:\\n\\n[11]: \"The Manifesto.\" This is the celebrated \"Communist Manifesto,\" which the Communist Congress, held in London, November, 1847, delegated Marx and Engels to draw up. It was published in 1848 (in London). The fundamental proposition of the Manifesto, Engels writes in his introduction to the \"Communist Manifesto,\" translated by S. Moore, and published by W. Reeves, \"is that in every historical epoch, the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange, and the social organization necessarily following from it, form the basis upon which is built up, and from which alone can be explained, the political and intellectual history of that epoch; that consequently the whole history of mankind has been a history of class struggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, ruling and oppressed classes; that nowadays a stage has been reached where the exploited and oppressed class—the proletariat—cannot attain its emancipation ... without at the same time, and once and for all emancipating society at large from all exploitation, oppression, class distinctions, and class struggles.\" As to this fundamental proposition of the Manifesto, it \"belongs,\" says Engels, \"wholly and solely to Marx.\" The \"Communist Manifesto\" has been translated into well-nigh every language, and is, again to quote Engels, \"the most international production of all Socialist literature.\"',\n",

At the time I really didn't know much about what was going around but I could tell my mom was always worried and concern. I didn't really know much about my dad because when I was only 3 he left Mexico to go work at U.S. but three years later my family thought it was time for us to be together once again. So around the year 2000 my mom left first to U.S., since she had left the only ones left were my older sister, my little brother, and I. My sister was in charge of us while my mom tried to figure out how much she would need to get us to come to America. The waiting seemed eternity to my sister but once the time came she told my little brother and I that it was time to be with mom again. I didn't really know where we were heading but all I knew was that I was going to reunite with my mom and that was all I really wanted.\\n\\nOnce we arrived here I could tell the environment was much more different. Even though it was 11pm at night everything just seemed so much bigger and brighter. There were so many different places to eat at and so many tall buildings. I honestly couldn't believe where I was at, I thought this was paradise, something out of a movie. I was so excited to start exploring everything around me. As time went by I realized how much life was better here. After several weeks I had completely forgot about being in Mexico but that was probably because of my age and I was still learning about what was going on around me.\\n\\nWhile all this was going on, I hadn't realize that pretty soon I had start going to school. I wasn't nerves at all, but once the time came I started getting butterflies and excited about starting this new journey. Walking in to this building I had notice how different schools were here then in Mexico. In mexico it was just two small building and our playground was just plain concrete in the middle of the two small buildings. But as for here, the building was big and so clean I couldn't even believe it was a school because of the way it looked. It wasn't until it was time for recces that I had realized that they had actual playgrounds. They had objects like slides, swings, and monkey bars. At that moment I just felt like I was in paradise.\\n\\nSeveral years went by and now it's my last year in high school. I still can't believe I have gotten this far. It feels as if the years just flew by. Sometimes I wish I could just go back to when I was first starting 1st grade here. I have yet to learn some much from the word and just like when I started my journey when I got here now it's time to start a new but this time on my own. I know that all these changes I have made in my life I can get use to any change that comes along my way.\",\n",

       " \"In the field of economics, the commodity value of a good is its free market intrinsic value under optimal use conditions. In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use.\\n\\nCURRENCY:\\nCommodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law.\\n\\n....__◥███◣\\n╱◥◣ ◥████◣\\n│╱◥█◣║∩©∩║\\n││☊.│ ▓ ║∩田 ║ **Suite2**\\nAsset backed debt has a commodity value equal to the price of the collateral; a loan backed by a house has a commodity value equal to the free market price of the house. Non-collateralized debt, on the other hand, does not have a commodity value; it is valuable only insofar as it is repaid.\\n\\nINVESTMENT:\\nCommodity value is an important consideration in hedging against inflation. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often catastrophically, currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining precious metals. This leads some investors to purchase goods and debts with high commodity value, which are inherently safer than those with low, or no commodity value, minimizing risk by sacrificing potential return.\",\n",

       " 'Part The Second\\n\\nSNITCHEY AND CRAGGS had a snug little office on the old Battle Ground, where they drove a snug little business, and fought a great many small pitched battles for a great many contending parties. Though it could hardly be said of these conflicts that they were running fights - for in truth they generally proceeded at a snail\\'s pace - the part the Firm had in them came so far within the general denomination, that now they took a shot at this Plaintiff, and now aimed a chop at that Defendant, now made a heavy charge at an estate in Chancery, and now had some light skirmishing among an irregular body of small debtors, just as the occasion served, and the enemy happened to present himself. The Gazette was an important and profitable feature in some of their fields, as in fields of greater renown; and in most of the Actions wherein they showed their generalship, it was afterwards observed by the combatants that they had had great difficulty in making each other out, or in knowing with any degree of distinctness what they were about, in consequence of the vast amount of smoke by which they were surrounded.\\n\\nThe offices of Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs stood convenient, with an open door down two smooth steps, in the market-place; so that any angry farmer inclining towards hot water, might tumble into it at once. Their special council-chamber and hall of conference was an old back-room up-stairs, with a low dark ceiling, which seemed to be knitting its brows gloomily in the consideration of tangled points of law. It was furnished with some high-backed leathern chairs, garnished with great goggle-eyed brass nails, of which, every here and there, two or three had fallen out - or had been picked out, perhaps, by the wandering thumbs and forefingers of bewildered clients. There was a framed print of a great judge in it, every curl in whose dreadful wig had made a man\\'s hair stand on end. Bales of papers filled the dusty closets, shelves, and tables; and round the wainscot there were tiers of boxes, padlocked and fireproof, with people\\'s names painted outside, which anxious visitors felt themselves, by a cruel enchantment, obliged to spell backwards and forwards, and to make anagrams of, while they sat, seeming to listen to Snitchey and Craggs, without comprehending one word of what they said.\\n\\nSnitchey and Craggs had each, in private life as in professional existence, a partner of his own. Snitchey and Craggs were the best friends in the world, and had a real confidence in one another; but Mrs. Snitchey, by a dispensation not uncommon in the affairs of life, was on principle suspicious of Mr. Craggs; and Mrs. Craggs was on principle suspicious of Mr. Snitchey. \\'Your Snitcheys indeed,\\' the latter lady would observe, sometimes, to Mr. Craggs; using that imaginative plural as if in disparagement of an objectionable pair of pantaloons, or other articles not possessed of a singular number; \\'I don\\'t see what you want with your Snitcheys, for my part. You trust a great deal too much to your Snitcheys, I think, and I hope you may never find my words come true.\\' While Mrs. Snitchey would observe to Mr. Snitchey, of Craggs, \\'that if ever he was led away by man he was led away by that man, and that if ever she read a double purpose in a mortal eye, she read that purpose in Craggs\\'s eye.\\' Notwithstanding this, however, they were all very good friends in general: and Mrs. Snitchey and Mrs. Craggs maintained a close bond of alliance against \\'the office,\\' which they both considered the Blue chamber, and common enemy, full of dangerous (because unknown) machinations.\\n\\nIn this office, nevertheless, Snitchey and Craggs made honey for their several hives. Here, sometimes, they would linger, of a fine evening, at the window of their council-chamber overlooking the old battle-ground, and wonder (but that was generally at assize time, when much business had made them sentimental) at the folly of mankind, who couldn\\'t always be at peace with one another and go to law comfortably. Here, days, and weeks, and months, and years, passed over them: their calendar, the gradually diminishing number of brass nails in the leathern chairs, and the increasing bulk of papers on the tables. Here, nearly three years\\' flight had thinned the one and swelled the other, since the breakfast in the orchard; when they sat together in consultation at night.\\n\\nNot alone; but, with a man of about thirty, or that time of life, negligently dressed, and somewhat haggard in the face, but well- made, well-attired, and well-looking, who sat in the armchair of state, with one hand in his breast, and the other in his dishevelled hair, pondering moodily. Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs sat opposite each other at a neighbouring desk. One of the fireproof boxes, unpadlocked and opened, was upon it; a part of its contents lay strewn upon the table, and the rest was then in course of passing through the hands of Mr. Snitchey; who brought it to the candle, document by document; looked at every paper singly, as he produced it; shook his head, and handed it to Mr. Craggs; who looked it over also, shook his head, and laid it down. Sometimes, they would stop, and shaking their heads in concert, look towards the abstracted client. And the name on the box being Michael Warden, Esquire, we may conclude from these premises that the name and the box were both his, and that the affairs of Michael Warden, Esquire, were in a bad way.\\n\\n\\'That\\'s all,\\' said Mr. Snitchey, turning up the last paper.\\n\\'Really there\\'s no other resource. No other resource.\\'\\n\\'All lost, spent, wasted, pawned, borrowed, and sold, eh?\\' said the client, looking up.\\n\\n\\'All,\\' returned Mr. Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'Nothing else to be done, you say?\\'\\n\\n\\'Nothing at all.\\'\\nThe client bit his nails, and pondered again.\\n\\n\\'And I am not even personally safe in England? You hold to that, do you?\\'\\n\\n\\'In no part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\\' replied Mr. Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'A mere prodigal son with no father to go back to, no swine to keep, and no husks to share with them? Eh?\\' pursued the client, rocking one leg over the other, and searching the ground with his eyes.\\n\\nMr. Snitchey coughed, as if to deprecate the being supposed to participate in any figurative illustration of a legal position. Mr. Craggs, as if to express that it was a partnership view of the subject, also coughed.\\n\\n\\'Ruined at thirty!\\' said the client. \\'Humph!\\'\\n\\n\\'Not ruined, Mr. Warden,\\' returned Snitchey. \\'Not so bad as that. You have done a good deal towards it, I must say, but you are not ruined. A little nursing - \\'\\n\\n\\'A little Devil,\\' said the client.\\n\\n\\'Mr. Craggs,\\' said Snitchey, \\'will you oblige me with a pinch of snuff? Thank you, sir.\\'\\n\\nAs the imperturbable lawyer applied it to his nose with great apparent relish and a perfect absorption of his attention in the proceeding, the client gradually broke into a smile, and, looking up, said:\\n\\n\\'You talk of nursing. How long nursing?\\'\\n\\n\\'How long nursing?\\' repeated Snitchey, dusting the snuff from his fingers, and making a slow calculation in his mind. \\'For your involved estate, sir? In good hands? S. and C.\\'s, say? Six or seven years.\\'\\n\\n\\'To starve for six or seven years!\\' said the client with a fretful laugh, and an impatient change of his position.\\n\\'To starve for six or seven years, Mr. Warden,\\' said Snitchey, \\'would be very uncommon indeed. You might get another estate by showing yourself, the while. But, we don\\'t think you could do it - speaking for Self and Craggs - and consequently don\\'t advise it.\\'\\n\\n\\'What DO you advise?\\'\\n\\n\\'Nursing, I say,\\' repeated Snitchey. \\'Some few years of nursing by Self and Craggs would bring it round. But to enable us to make terms, and hold terms, and you to keep terms, you must go away; you must live abroad. As to starvation, we could ensure you some hundreds a-year to starve upon, even in the beginning - I dare say, Mr. Warden.\\'\\n\\n\\'Hundreds,\\' said the client. \\'And I have spent thousands!\\'\\n\\n\\'That,\\' retorted Mr. Snitchey, putting the papers slowly back into the cast-iron box, \\'there is no doubt about. No doubt about,\\' he repeated to himself, as he thoughtfully pursued his occupation.\\n\\nThe lawyer very likely knew HIS man; at any rate his dry, shrewd, whimsical manner, had a favourable influence on the client\\'s moody state, and disposed him to be more free and unreserved. Or, perhaps the client knew HIS man, and had elicited such encouragement as he had received, to render some purpose he was about to disclose the more defensible in appearance. Gradually raising his head, he sat looking at his immovable adviser with a smile, which presently broke into a laugh.\\n\\n\\'After all,\\' he said, \\'my iron-headed friend - \\'\\n\\nMr. Snitchey pointed out his partner. \\'Self and - excuse me -\\nCraggs.\\'\\n\\'I beg Mr. Craggs\\'s pardon,\\' said the client. \\'After all, my iron- headed friends,\\' he leaned forward in his chair, and dropped his voice a little, \\'you don\\'t know half my ruin yet.\\'\\n\\nMr. Snitchey stopped and stared at him. Mr. Craggs also stared.\\n\\n\\'I am not only deep in debt,\\' said the client, \\'but I am deep in - \\'\\n\\n\\'Not in love!\\' cried Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' said the client, falling back in his chair, and surveying the Firm with his hands in his pockets. \\'Deep in love.\\'\\n\\'And not with an heiress, sir?\\' said Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'Not with an heiress.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nor a rich lady?\\'\\n\\n\\'Nor a rich lady that I know of - except in beauty and merit.\\'\\n\\n\\'A single lady, I trust?\\' said Mr. Snitchey, with great expression.\\n\\n\\'Certainly.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s not one of Dr. Jeddler\\'s daughters?\\' said Snitchey, suddenly squaring his elbows on his knees, and advancing his face at least a yard.\\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' returned the client.\\n\\n\\'Not his younger daughter?\\' said Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'Yes!\\' returned the client.\\n\\n\\'Mr. Craggs,\\' said Snitchey, much relieved, \\'will you oblige me with another pinch of snuff? Thank you! I am happy to say it don\\'t signify, Mr. Warden; she\\'s engaged, sir, she\\'s bespoke. My partner can corroborate me. We know the fact.\\'\\n\\n\\'We know the fact,\\' repeated Craggs.\\n\\n\\'Why, so do I perhaps,\\' returned the client quietly. \\'What of that! Are you men of the world, and did you never hear of a woman changing her mind?\\'\\n\\n\\'There certainly have been actions for breach,\\' said Mr. Snitchey, \\'brought against both spinsters and widows, but, in the majority of cases - \\'\\n\\n\\'Cases!\\' interposed the client, impatiently. \\'Don\\'t talk to me of cases. The general precedent is in a much larger volume than any of your law books. Besides, do you think I have lived six weeks in the Doctor\\'s house for nothing?\\'\\n\\n\\'I think, sir,\\' observed Mr. Snitchey, gravely addressing himself to his partner, \\'that of all the scrapes Mr. Warden\\'s horses have brought him into at one time and another - and they have been pretty numerous, and pretty expensive, as none know better than himself, and you, and I - the worst scrape may turn out to be, if he talks in this way, this having ever been left by one of them at the Doctor\\'s garden wall, with three broken ribs, a snapped collar- bone, and the Lord knows how many bruises. We didn\\'t think so much of it, at the time when we knew he was going on well under the Doctor\\'s hands and roof; but it looks bad now, sir. Bad? It looks very bad. Doctor Jeddler too - our client, Mr. Craggs.\\'\\n\\n\\'Mr. Alfred Heathfield too - a sort of client, Mr. Snitchey,\\' said\\nCraggs.\\n\\'Mr. Michael Warden too, a kind of client,\\' said the careless visitor, \\'and no bad one either: having played the fool for ten or twelve years. However, Mr. Michael Warden has sown his wild oats now - there\\'s their crop, in that box; and he means to repent and be wise. And in proof of it, Mr. Michael Warden means, if he can, to marry Marion, the Doctor\\'s lovely daughter, and to carry her away with him.\\'\\n\\n\\'Really, Mr. Craggs,\\' Snitchey began.\\n\\n\\'Really, Mr. Snitchey, and Mr. Craggs, partners both,\\' said the client, interrupting him; \\'you know your duty to your clients, and you know well enough, I am sure, that it is no part of it to interfere in a mere love affair, which I am obliged to confide to you. I am not going to carry the young lady off, without her own consent. There\\'s nothing illegal in it. I never was Mr. Heathfield\\'s bosom friend. I violate no confidence of his. I love where he loves, and I mean to win where he would win, if I can.\\'\\n\\n\\'He can\\'t, Mr. Craggs,\\' said Snitchey, evidently anxious and discomfited. \\'He can\\'t do it, sir. She dotes on Mr. Alfred.\\'\\n\\n\\'Does she?\\' returned the client.\\n\\n\\'Mr. Craggs, she dotes on him, sir,\\' persisted Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'I didn\\'t live six weeks, some few months ago, in the Doctor\\'s house for nothing; and I doubted that soon,\\' observed the client. \\'She would have doted on him, if her sister could have brought it about; but I watched them. Marion avoided his name, avoided the subject: shrunk from the least allusion to it, with evident distress.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why should she, Mr. Craggs, you know? Why should she, sir?\\' inquired Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know why she should, though there are many likely reasons,\\' said the client, smiling at the attention and perplexity expressed in Mr. Snitchey\\'s shining eye, and at his cautious way of carrying on the conversation, and making himself informed upon the subject; \\'but I know she does. She was very young when she made the engagement - if it may be called one, I am not even sure of that - and has repented of it, perhaps. Perhaps - it seems a foppish thing to say, but upon my soul I don\\'t mean it in that light - she may have fallen in love with me, as I have fallen in love with her.\\'\\n\\n\\'He, he! Mr. Alfred, her old playfellow too, you remember, Mr. Craggs,\\' said Snitchey, with a disconcerted laugh; \\'knew her almost from a baby!\\'\\n\\n\\'Which makes it the more probable that she may be tired of his idea,\\' calmly pursued the client, \\'and not indisposed to exchange it for the newer one of another lover, who presents himself (or is presented by his horse) under romantic circumstances; has the not unfavourable reputation - with a country girl - of having lived thoughtlessly and gaily, without doing much harm to anybody; and who, for his youth and figure, and so forth - this may seem foppish again, but upon my soul I don\\'t mean it in that light - might perhaps pass muster in a crowd with Mr. Alfred himself.\\'\\n\\nThere was no gainsaying the last clause, certainly; and Mr. Snitchey, glancing at him, thought so. There was something naturally graceful and pleasant in the very carelessness of his air. It seemed to suggest, of his comely face and well-knit figure, that they might be greatly better if he chose: and that, once roused and made earnest (but he never had been earnest yet), he could be full of fire and purpose. \\'A dangerous sort of libertine,\\' thought the shrewd lawyer, \\'to seem to catch the spark he wants, from a young lady\\'s eyes.\\'\\n\\n\\'Now, observe, Snitchey,\\' he continued, rising and taking him by the button, \\'and Craggs,\\' taking him by the button also, and placing one partner on either side of him, so that neither might evade him. \\'I don\\'t ask you for any advice. You are right to keep quite aloof from all parties in such a matter, which is not one in which grave men like you could interfere, on any side. I am briefly going to review in half-a-dozen words, my position and intention, and then I shall leave it to you to do the best for me, in money matters, that you can: seeing, that, if I run away with the Doctor\\'s beautiful daughter (as I hope to do, and to become another man under her bright influence), it will be, for the moment, more chargeable than running away alone. But I shall soon make all that up in an altered life.\\'\\n\\n\\'I think it will be better not to hear this, Mr. Craggs?\\' said\\nSnitchey, looking at him across the client.\\n\\'I think not,\\' said Craggs. - Both listened attentively.\\n\\n\\'Well! You needn\\'t hear it,\\' replied their client. \\'I\\'ll mention it, however. I don\\'t mean to ask the Doctor\\'s consent, because he wouldn\\'t give it me. But I mean to do the Doctor no wrong or harm, because (besides there being nothing serious in such trifles, as he says) I hope to rescue his child, my Marion, from what I see - I KNOW - she dreads, and contemplates with misery: that is, the return of this old lover. If anything in the world is true, it is true that she dreads his return. Nobody is injured so far. I am so harried and worried here just now, that I lead the life of a flying-fish. I skulk about in the dark, I am shut out of my own house, and warned off my own grounds; but, that house, and those grounds, and many an acre besides, will come back to me one day, as you know and say; and Marion will probably be richer - on your showing, who are never sanguine - ten years hence as my wife, than as the wife of Alfred Heathfield, whose return she dreads (remember that), and in whom or in any man, my passion is not surpassed. Who is injured yet? It is a fair case throughout. My right is as good as his, if she decide in my favour; and I will try my right by her alone. You will like to know no more after this, and I will tell you no more. Now you know my purpose, and wants. When must I leave here?\\'\\n\\n\\'In a week,\\' said Snitchey. \\'Mr. Craggs?\\'\\n\\n\\'In something less, I should say,\\' responded Craggs.\\n\\n\\'In a month,\\' said the client, after attentively watching the two faces. \\'This day month. To-day is Thursday. Succeed or fail, on this day month I go.\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s too long a delay,\\' said Snitchey; \\'much too long. But let it be so. I thought he\\'d have stipulated for three,\\' he murmured to himself. \\'Are you going? Good night, sir!\\'\\n\\n\\'Good night!\\' returned the client, shaking hands with the Firm.\\n\\n\\'You\\'ll live to see me making a good use of riches yet. Henceforth the star of my destiny is, Marion!\\'\\n\\n\\'Take care of the stairs, sir,\\' replied Snitchey; \\'for she don\\'t shine there. Good night!\\'\\n\\n\\'Good night!\\'\\n\\nSo they both stood at the stair-head with a pair of office-candles, watching him down. When he had gone away, they stood looking at each other.\\n\\n\\'What do you think of all this, Mr. Craggs?\\' said Snitchey.\\n\\nMr. Craggs shook his head.\\n\\n\\'It was our opinion, on the day when that release was executed, that there was something curious in the parting of that pair; I recollect,\\' said Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'It was,\\' said Mr. Craggs.\\n\\n\\'Perhaps he deceives himself altogether,\\' pursued Mr. Snitchey, locking up the fireproof box, and putting it away; \\'or, if he don\\'t, a little bit of fickleness and perfidy is not a miracle, Mr. Craggs. And yet I thought that pretty face was very true. I thought,\\' said Mr. Snitchey, putting on his great-coat (for the weather was very cold), drawing on his gloves, and snuffing out one candle, \\'that I had even seen her character becoming stronger and more resolved of late. More like her sister\\'s.\\'\\n\\n\\'Mrs. Craggs was of the same opinion,\\' returned Craggs.\\n\\n\\'I\\'d really give a trifle to-night,\\' observed Mr. Snitchey, who was a good-natured man, \\'if I could believe that Mr. Warden was reckoning without his host; but, light-headed, capricious, and unballasted as he is, he knows something of the world and its people (he ought to, for he has bought what he does know, dear enough); and I can\\'t quite think that. We had better not interfere: we can do nothing, Mr. Craggs, but keep quiet.\\'\\n\\n\\'Nothing,\\' returned Craggs.\\n\\n\\'Our friend the Doctor makes light of such things,\\' said Mr. Snitchey, shaking his head. \\'I hope he mayn\\'t stand in need of his philosophy. Our friend Alfred talks of the battle of life,\\' he shook his head again, \\'I hope he mayn\\'t be cut down early in the day. Have you got your hat, Mr. Craggs? I am going to put the other candle out.\\' Mr. Craggs replying in the affirmative, Mr. Snitchey suited the action to the word, and they groped their way out of the council-chamber, now dark as the subject, or the law in general.\\n\\nMy story passes to a quiet little study, where, on that same night, the sisters and the hale old Doctor sat by a cheerful fireside. Grace was working at her needle. Marion read aloud from a book before her. The Doctor, in his dressing-gown and slippers, with his feet spread out upon the warm rug, leaned back in his easy- chair, and listened to the book, and looked upon his daughters.\\n\\nThey were very beautiful to look upon. Two better faces for a fireside, never made a fireside bright and sacred. Something of the difference between them had been softened down in three years\\' time; and enthroned upon the clear brow of the younger sister, looking through her eyes, and thrilling in her voice, was the same earnest nature that her own motherless youth had ripened in the elder sister long ago. But she still appeared at once the lovelier and weaker of the two; still seemed to rest her head upon her sister\\'s breast, and put her trust in her, and look into her eyes for counsel and reliance. Those loving eyes, so calm, serene, and cheerful, as of old.\\n\\n\\'\"And being in her own home,\"\\' read Marion, from the book; \\'\"her home made exquisitely dear by these remembrances, she now began to know that the great trial of her heart must soon come on, and could not be delayed. O Home, our comforter and friend when others fall away, to part with whom, at any step between the cradle and the grave\"\\'-\\n\\n\\'Marion, my love!\\' said Grace.\\n\\n\\'Why, Puss!\\' exclaimed her father, \\'what\\'s the matter?\\'\\n\\nShe put her hand upon the hand her sister stretched towards her, and read on; her voice still faltering and trembling, though she made an effort to command it when thus interrupted.\\n\\n\\'\"To part with whom, at any step between the cradle and the grave, is always sorrowful. O Home, so true to us, so often slighted in return, be lenient to them that turn away from thee, and do not haunt their erring footsteps too reproachfully! Let no kind looks, no well-remembered smiles, be seen upon thy phantom face. Let no ray of affection, welcome, gentleness, forbearance, cordiality, shine from thy white head. Let no old loving word, or tone, rise up in judgment against thy deserter; but if thou canst look harshly and severely, do, in mercy to the Penitent!\"\\'\\n\\n\\'Dear Marion, read no more to-night,\\' said Grace for she was weeping.\\n\\n\\'I cannot,\\' she replied, and closed the book. \\'The words seem all on fire!\\'\\n\\nThe Doctor was amused at this; and laughed as he patted her on the head.\\n\\n\\'What! overcome by a story-book!\\' said Doctor Jeddler. \\'Print and paper! Well, well, it\\'s all one. It\\'s as rational to make a serious matter of print and paper as of anything else. But, dry your eyes, love, dry your eyes. I dare say the heroine has got home again long ago, and made it up all round - and if she hasn\\'t, a real home is only four walls; and a fictitious one, mere rags and ink. What\\'s the matter now?\\'\\n\\n\\'It\\'s only me, Mister,\\' said Clemency, putting in her head at the door.\\n\\n\\'And what\\'s the matter with YOU?\\' said the Doctor.\\n\\n\\'Oh, bless you, nothing an\\'t the matter with me,\\' returned Clemency - and truly too, to judge from her well-soaped face, in which there gleamed as usual the very soul of good-humour, which, ungainly as she was, made her quite engaging. Abrasions on the elbows are not generally understood, it is true, to range within that class of personal charms called beauty-spots. But, it is better, going through the world, to have the arms chafed in that narrow passage, than the temper: and Clemency\\'s was sound and whole as any beauty\\'s in the land.\\n\\n\\'Nothing an\\'t the matter with me,\\' said Clemency, entering, \\'but - come a little closer, Mister.\\'\\n\\nThe Doctor, in some astonishment, complied with this invitation.\\n\\n\\'You said I wasn\\'t to give you one before them, you know,\\' said\\nClemency.\\nA novice in the family might have supposed, from her extraordinary ogling as she said it, as well as from a singular rapture or ecstasy which pervaded her elbows, as if she were embracing herself, that \\'one,\\' in its most favourable interpretation, meant a chaste salute. Indeed the Doctor himself seemed alarmed, for the moment; but quickly regained his composure, as Clemency, having had recourse to both her pockets - beginning with the right one, going away to the wrong one, and afterwards coming back to the right one again - produced a letter from the Post-office.\\n\\n\\'Britain was riding by on a errand,\\' she chuckled, handing it to the Doctor, \\'and see the mail come in, and waited for it. There\\'s A. H. in the corner. Mr. Alfred\\'s on his journey home, I bet. We shall have a wedding in the house - there was two spoons in my saucer this morning. Oh Luck, how slow he opens it!\\'\\n\\nAll this she delivered, by way of soliloquy, gradually rising higher and higher on tiptoe, in her impatience to hear the news, and making a corkscrew of her apron, and a bottle of her mouth. At last, arriving at a climax of suspense, and seeing the Doctor still engaged in the perusal of the letter, she came down flat upon the soles of her feet again, and cast her apron, as a veil, over her head, in a mute despair, and inability to bear it any longer.\\n\\n\\'Here! Girls!\\' cried the Doctor. \\'I can\\'t help it: I never could keep a secret in my life. There are not many secrets, indeed, worth being kept in such a - well! never mind that. Alfred\\'s coming home, my dears, directly.\\'\\n\\n\\'Directly!\\' exclaimed Marion.\\n\\n\\'What! The story-book is soon forgotten!\\' said the Doctor, pinching her cheek. \\'I thought the news would dry those tears. Yes. \"Let it be a surprise,\" he says, here. But I can\\'t let it be a surprise. He must have a welcome.\\'\\n\\n\\'Directly!\\' repeated Marion.\\n\\n\\'Why, perhaps not what your impatience calls \"directly,\"\\' returned the doctor; \\'but pretty soon too. Let us see. Let us see. To-day is Thursday, is it not? Then he promises to be here, this day month.\\'\\n\\n\\'This day month!\\' repeated Marion, softly.\\n\\n\\'A gay day and a holiday for us,\\' said the cheerful voice of her sister Grace, kissing her in congratulation. \\'Long looked forward to, dearest, and come at last.\\'\\n\\nShe answered with a smile; a mournful smile, but full of sisterly affection. As she looked in her sister\\'s face, and listened to the quiet music of her voice, picturing the happiness of this return, her own face glowed with hope and joy.\\n\\nAnd with a something else; a something shining more and more through all the rest of its expression; for which I have no name. It was not exultation, triumph, proud enthusiasm. They are not so calmly shown. It was not love and gratitude alone, though love and gratitude were part of it. It emanated from no sordid thought, for sordid thoughts do not light up the brow, and hover on the lips, and move the spirit like a fluttered light, until the sympathetic figure trembles.\\n\\nDr. Jeddler, in spite of his system of philosophy - which he was continually contradicting and denying in practice, but more famous philosophers have done that - could not help having as much interest in the return of his old ward and pupil as if it had been a serious event. So he sat himself down in his easy-chair again, stretched out his slippered feet once more upon the rug, read the letter over and over a great many times, and talked it over more times still.\\n\\n\\'Ah! The day was,\\' said the Doctor, looking at the fire, \\'when you and he, Grace, used to trot about arm-in-arm, in his holiday time, like a couple of walking dolls. You remember?\\'\\n\\n\\'I remember,\\' she answered, with her pleasant laugh, and plying her needle busily.\\n\\n\\'This day month, indeed!\\' mused the Doctor. \\'That hardly seems a twelve month ago. And where was my little Marion then!\\'\\n\\n\\'Never far from her sister,\\' said Marion, cheerily, \\'however little. Grace was everything to me, even when she was a young child herself.\\'\\n\\n\\'True, Puss, true,\\' returned the Doctor. \\'She was a staid little woman, was Grace, and a wise housekeeper, and a busy, quiet, pleasant body; bearing with our humours and anticipating our wishes, and always ready to forget her own, even in those times. I never knew you positive or obstinate, Grace, my darling, even then, on any subject but one.\\'\\n\\n\\'I am afraid I have changed sadly for the worse, since,\\' laughed\\nGrace, still busy at her work. \\'What was that one, father?\\'\\n\\'Alfred, of course,\\' said the Doctor. \\'Nothing would serve you but you must be called Alfred\\'s wife; so we called you Alfred\\'s wife; and you liked it better, I believe (odd as it seems now), than being called a Duchess, if we could have made you one.\\'\\n\\n\\'Indeed?\\' said Grace, placidly.\\n\\n\\'Why, don\\'t you remember?\\' inquired the Doctor.\\n\\n\\'I think I remember something of it,\\' she returned, \\'but not much. It\\'s so long ago.\\' And as she sat at work, she hummed the burden of an old song, which the Doctor liked.\\n\\n\\'Alfred will find a real wife soon,\\' she said, breaking off; \\'and that will be a happy time indeed for all of us. My three years\\' trust is nearly at an end, Marion. It has been a very easy one. I shall tell Alfred, when I give you back to him, that you have loved him dearly all the time, and that he has never once needed my good services. May I tell him so, love?\\'\\n\\n\\'Tell him, dear Grace,\\' replied Marion, \\'that there never was a trust so generously, nobly, steadfastly discharged; and that I have loved YOU, all the time, dearer and dearer every day; and O! how dearly now!\\'\\n\\n\\'Nay,\\' said her cheerful sister, returning her embrace, \\'I can scarcely tell him that; we will leave my deserts to Alfred\\'s imagination. It will be liberal enough, dear Marion; like your own.\\'\\n\\nWith that, she resumed the work she had for a moment laid down, when her sister spoke so fervently: and with it the old song the Doctor liked to hear. And the Doctor, still reposing in his easy- chair, with his slippered feet stretched out before him on the rug, listened to the tune, and beat time on his knee with Alfred\\'s letter, and looked at his two daughters, and thought that among the many trifles of the trifling world, these trifles were agreeable enough.\\n\\nClemency Newcome, in the meantime, having accomplished her mission and lingered in the room until she had made herself a party to the news, descended to the kitchen, where her coadjutor, Mr. Britain, was regaling after supper, surrounded by such a plentiful collection of bright pot-lids, well-scoured saucepans, burnished dinner-covers, gleaming kettles, and other tokens of her industrious habits, arranged upon the walls and shelves, that he sat as in the centre of a hall of mirrors. The majority did not give forth very flattering portraits of him, certainly; nor were they by any means unanimous in their reflections; as some made him very long-faced, others very broad-faced, some tolerably well- looking, others vastly ill-looking, according to their several manners of reflecting: which were as various, in respect of one fact, as those of so many kinds of men. But they all agreed that in the midst of them sat, quite at his ease, an individual with a pipe in his mouth, and a jug of beer at his elbow, who nodded condescendingly to Clemency, when she stationed herself at the same table.\\n\\n\\'Well, Clemmy,\\' said Britain, \\'how are you by this time, and what\\'s the news?\\'\\n\\nClemency told him the news, which he received very graciously. A gracious change had come over Benjamin from head to foot. He was much broader, much redder, much more cheerful, and much jollier in all respects. It seemed as if his face had been tied up in a knot before, and was now untwisted and smoothed out.\\n\\n\\'There\\'ll be another job for Snitchey and Craggs, I suppose,\\' he observed, puffing slowly at his pipe. \\'More witnessing for you and me, perhaps, Clemmy!\\'\\n\\n\\'Lor!\\' replied his fair companion, with her favourite twist of her favourite joints. \\'I wish it was me, Britain!\\'\\n\\n\\'Wish what was you?\\'\\n\\n\\'A-going to be married,\\' said Clemency.\\n\\nBenjamin took his pipe out of his mouth and laughed heartily. \\'Yes! you\\'re a likely subject for that!\\' he said. \\'Poor Clem!\\' Clemency for her part laughed as heartily as he, and seemed as much amused by the idea. \\'Yes,\\' she assented, \\'I\\'m a likely subject for that; an\\'t I?\\'\\n\\n\\'YOU\\'LL never be married, you know,\\' said Mr. Britain, resuming his pipe.\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you think I ever shall though?\\' said Clemency, in perfect good faith.\\n\\nMr. Britain shook his head. \\'Not a chance of it!\\'\\n\\n\\'Only think!\\' said Clemency. \\'Well! - I suppose you mean to,\\nBritain, one of these days; don\\'t you?\\'\\nA question so abrupt, upon a subject so momentous, required consideration. After blowing out a great cloud of smoke, and looking at it with his head now on this side and now on that, as if it were actually the question, and he were surveying it in various aspects, Mr. Britain replied that he wasn\\'t altogether clear about it, but - ye-es - he thought he might come to that at last.\\n\\n\\'I wish her joy, whoever she may be!\\' cried Clemency.\\n\\n\\'Oh she\\'ll have that,\\' said Benjamin, \\'safe enough.\\'\\n\\n\\'But she wouldn\\'t have led quite such a joyful life as she will lead, and wouldn\\'t have had quite such a sociable sort of husband as she will have,\\' said Clemency, spreading herself half over the table, and staring retrospectively at the candle, \\'if it hadn\\'t been for - not that I went to do it, for it was accidental, I am sure - if it hadn\\'t been for me; now would she, Britain?\\'\\n\\n\\'Certainly not,\\' returned Mr. Britain, by this time in that high state of appreciation of his pipe, when a man can open his mouth but a very little way for speaking purposes; and sitting luxuriously immovable in his chair, can afford to turn only his eyes towards a companion, and that very passively and gravely. \\'Oh! I\\'m greatly beholden to you, you know, Clem.\\'\\n\\n\\'Lor, how nice that is to think of!\\' said Clemency.\\n\\nAt the same time, bringing her thoughts as well as her sight to bear upon the candle-grease, and becoming abruptly reminiscent of its healing qualities as a balsam, she anointed her left elbow with a plentiful application of that remedy.\\n\\n\\'You see I\\'ve made a good many investigations of one sort and another in my time,\\' pursued Mr. Britain, with the profundity of a sage, \\'having been always of an inquiring turn of mind; and I\\'ve read a good many books about the general Rights of things and Wrongs of things, for I went into the literary line myself, when I began life.\\'\\n\\n\\'Did you though!\\' cried the admiring Clemency.\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Mr. Britain: \\'I was hid for the best part of two years behind a bookstall, ready to fly out if anybody pocketed a volume; and after that, I was light porter to a stay and mantua maker, in which capacity I was employed to carry about, in oilskin baskets, nothing but deceptions - which soured my spirits and disturbed my confidence in human nature; and after that, I heard a world of discussions in this house, which soured my spirits fresh; and my opinion after all is, that, as a safe and comfortable sweetener of the same, and as a pleasant guide through life, there\\'s nothing like a nutmeg-grater.\\'\\n\\nClemency was about to offer a suggestion, but he stopped her by anticipating it.\\n\\n\\'Com-bined,\\' he added gravely, \\'with a thimble.\\'\\n\\n\\'Do as you wold, you know, and cetrer, eh!\\' observed Clemency, folding her arms comfortably in her delight at this avowal, and patting her elbows. \\'Such a short cut, an\\'t it?\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m not sure,\\' said Mr. Britain, \\'that it\\'s what would be considered good philosophy. I\\'ve my doubts about that; but it wears well, and saves a quantity of snarling, which the genuine article don\\'t always.\\'\\n\\n\\'See how you used to go on once, yourself, you know!\\' said\\nClemency.\\n\\'Ah!\\' said Mr. Britain. \\'But the most extraordinary thing, Clemmy, is that I should live to be brought round, through you. That\\'s the strange part of it. Through you! Why, I suppose you haven\\'t so much as half an idea in your head.\\'\\n\\nClemency, without taking the least offence, shook it, and laughed and hugged herself, and said, \\'No, she didn\\'t suppose she had.\\'\\n\\n\\'I\\'m pretty sure of it,\\' said Mr. Britain.\\n\\n\\'Oh! I dare say you\\'re right,\\' said Clemency. \\'I don\\'t pretend to none. I don\\'t want any.\\'\\n\\nBenjamin took his pipe from his lips, and laughed till the tears ran down his face. \\'What a natural you are, Clemmy!\\' he said, shaking his head, with an infinite relish of the joke, and wiping his eyes. Clemency, without the smallest inclination to dispute it, did the like, and laughed as heartily as he.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t help liking you,\\' said Mr. Britain; \\'you\\'re a regular good creature in your way, so shake hands, Clem. Whatever happens, I\\'ll always take notice of you, and be a friend to you.\\'\\n\\n\\'Will you?\\' returned Clemency. \\'Well! that\\'s very good of you.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, yes,\\' said Mr. Britain, giving her his pipe to knock the ashes out of it; \\'I\\'ll stand by you. Hark! That\\'s a curious noise!\\'\\n\\n\\'Noise!\\' repeated Clemency.\\n\\n\\'A footstep outside. Somebody dropping from the wall, it sounded like,\\' said Britain. \\'Are they all abed up-stairs?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, all abed by this time,\\' she replied.\\n\\n\\'Didn\\'t you hear anything?\\'\\n\\n\\'No.\\'\\n\\nThey both listened, but heard nothing.\\n\\n\\'I tell you what,\\' said Benjamin, taking down a lantern. \\'I\\'ll have a look round, before I go to bed myself, for satisfaction\\'s sake. Undo the door while I light this, Clemmy.\\'\\n\\nClemency complied briskly; but observed as she did so, that he would only have his walk for his pains, that it was all his fancy, and so forth. Mr. Britain said \\'very likely;\\' but sallied out, nevertheless, armed with the poker, and casting the light of the lantern far and near in all directions.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s as quiet as a churchyard,\\' said Clemency, looking after him; \\'and almost as ghostly too!\\'\\n\\nGlancing back into the kitchen, she cried fearfully, as a light figure stole into her view, \\'What\\'s that!\\'\\n\\n\\'Hush!\\' said Marion in an agitated whisper. \\'You have always loved me, have you not!\\'\\n\\n\\'Loved you, child! You may be sure I have.\\'\\n\\n\\'I am sure. And I may trust you, may I not? There is no one else just now, in whom I CAN trust.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said Clemency, with all her heart.\\n\\n\\'There is some one out there,\\' pointing to the door, \\'whom I must see, and speak with, to-night. Michael Warden, for God\\'s sake retire! Not now!\\'\\n\\nClemency started with surprise and trouble as, following the direction of the speaker\\'s eyes, she saw a dark figure standing in the doorway.\\n\\n\\'In another moment you may be discovered,\\' said Marion. \\'Not now!\\nWait, if you can, in some concealment. I will come presently.\\'\\nHe waved his hand to her, and was gone. \\'Don\\'t go to bed. Wait here for me!\\' said Marion, hurriedly. \\'I have been seeking to speak to you for an hour past. Oh, be true to me!\\'\\n\\nEagerly seizing her bewildered hand, and pressing it with both her own to her breast - an action more expressive, in its passion of entreaty, than the most eloquent appeal in words, - Marion withdrew; as the light of the returning lantern flashed into the room.\\n\\n\\'All still and peaceable. Nobody there. Fancy, I suppose,\\' said Mr. Britain, as he locked and barred the door. \\'One of the effects of having a lively imagination. Halloa! Why, what\\'s the matter?\\'\\n\\nClemency, who could not conceal the effects of her surprise and concern, was sitting in a chair: pale, and trembling from head to foot.\\n\\n\\'Matter!\\' she repeated, chafing her hands and elbows, nervously, and looking anywhere but at him. \\'That\\'s good in you, Britain, that is! After going and frightening one out of one\\'s life with noises and lanterns, and I don\\'t know what all. Matter! Oh, yes!\\'\\n\\n\\'If you\\'re frightened out of your life by a lantern, Clemmy,\\' said Mr. Britain, composedly blowing it out and hanging it up again, \\'that apparition\\'s very soon got rid of. But you\\'re as bold as brass in general,\\' he said, stopping to observe her; \\'and were, after the noise and the lantern too. What have you taken into your head? Not an idea, eh?\\'\\n\\nBut, as Clemency bade him good night very much after her usual fashion, and began to bustle about with a show of going to bed herself immediately, Little Britain, after giving utterance to the original remark that it was impossible to account for a woman\\'s whims, bade her good night in return, and taking up his candle strolled drowsily away to bed.\\n\\nWhen all was quiet, Marion returned.\\n\\n\\'Open the door,\\' she said; \\'and stand there close beside me, while\\nI speak to him, outside.\\'\\nTimid as her manner was, it still evinced a resolute and settled purpose, such as Clemency could not resist. She softly unbarred the door: but before turning the key, looked round on the young creature waiting to issue forth when she should open it.\\n\\nThe face was not averted or cast down, but looking full upon her, in its pride of youth and beauty. Some simple sense of the slightness of the barrier that interposed itself between the happy home and honoured love of the fair girl, and what might be the desolation of that home, and shipwreck of its dearest treasure, smote so keenly on the tender heart of Clemency, and so filled it to overflowing with sorrow and compassion, that, bursting into tears, she threw her arms round Marion\\'s neck.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s little that I know, my dear,\\' cried Clemency, \\'very little; but I know that this should not be. Think of what you do!\\'\\n\\n\\'I have thought of it many times,\\' said Marion, gently.\\n\\n\\'Once more,\\' urged Clemency. \\'Till to-morrow.\\' Marion shook her head.\\n\\n\\'For Mr. Alfred\\'s sake,\\' said Clemency, with homely earnestness.\\n\\'Him that you used to love so dearly, once!\\'\\nShe hid her face, upon the instant, in her hands, repeating \\'Once!\\' as if it rent her heart.\\n\\n\\'Let me go out,\\' said Clemency, soothing her. \\'I\\'ll tell him what you like. Don\\'t cross the door-step to-night. I\\'m sure no good will come of it. Oh, it was an unhappy day when Mr. Warden was ever brought here! Think of your good father, darling - of your sister.\\'\\n\\n\\'I have,\\' said Marion, hastily raising her head. \\'You don\\'t know what I do. I MUST speak to him. You are the best and truest friend in all the world for what you have said to me, but I must take this step. Will you go with me, Clemency,\\' she kissed her on her friendly face, \\'or shall I go alone?\\'\\n\\nSorrowing and wondering, Clemency turned the key, and opened the door. Into the dark and doubtful night that lay beyond the threshold, Marion passed quickly, holding by her hand.\\n\\nIn the dark night he joined her, and they spoke together earnestly and long; and the hand that held so fast by Clemeney\\'s, now trembled, now turned deadly cold, now clasped and closed on hers, in the strong feeling of the speech it emphasised unconsciously. When they returned, he followed to the door, and pausing there a moment, seized the other hand, and pressed it to his lips. Then, stealthily withdrew.\\n\\nThe door was barred and locked again, and once again she stood beneath her father\\'s roof. Not bowed down by the secret that she brought there, though so young; but, with that same expression on her face for which I had no name before, and shining through her tears.\\n\\nAgain she thanked and thanked her humble friend, and trusted to her, as she said, with confidence, implicitly. Her chamber safely reached, she fell upon her knees; and with her secret weighing on her heart, could pray!\\n\\nCould rise up from her prayers, so tranquil and serene, and bending over her fond sister in her slumber, look upon her face and smile - though sadly: murmuring as she kissed her forehead, how that Grace had been a mother to her, ever, and she loved her as a child!\\n\\nCould draw the passive arm about her neck when lying down to rest - it seemed to cling there, of its own will, protectingly and tenderly even in sleep - and breathe upon the parted lips, God bless her!\\n\\nCould sink into a peaceful sleep, herself; but for one dream, in which she cried out, in her innocent and touching voice, that she was quite alone, and they had all forgotten her.\\n\\nA month soon passes, even at its tardiest pace. The month appointed to elapse between that night and the return, was quick of foot, and went by, like a vapour.\\n\\nThe day arrived. A raging winter day, that shook the old house, sometimes, as if it shivered in the blast. A day to make home doubly home. To give the chimney-corner new delights. To shed a ruddier glow upon the faces gathered round the hearth, and draw each fireside group into a closer and more social league, against the roaring elements without. Such a wild winter day as best prepares the way for shut-out night; for curtained rooms, and cheerful looks; for music, laughter, dancing, light, and jovial entertainment!\\n\\nAll these the Doctor had in store to welcome Alfred back. They knew that he could not arrive till night; and they would make the night air ring, he said, as he approached. All his old friends should congregate about him. He should not miss a face that he had known and liked. No! They should every one be there!\\n\\nSo, guests were bidden, and musicians were engaged, and tables spread, and floors prepared for active feet, and bountiful provision made, of every hospitable kind. Because it was the Christmas season, and his eyes were all unused to English holly and its sturdy green, the dancing-room was garlanded and hung with it; and the red berries gleamed an English welcome to him, peeping from among the leaves.\\n\\nIt was a busy day for all of them: a busier day for none of them than Grace, who noiselessly presided everywhere, and was the cheerful mind of all the preparations. Many a time that day (as well as many a time within the fleeting month preceding it), did Clemency glance anxiously, and almost fearfully, at Marion. She saw her paler, perhaps, than usual; but there was a sweet composure on her face that made it lovelier than ever.\\n\\nAt night when she was dressed, and wore upon her head a wreath that Grace had proudly twined about it - its mimic flowers were Alfred\\'s favourites, as Grace remembered when she chose them - that old expression, pensive, almost sorrowful, and yet so spiritual, high, and stirring, sat again upon her brow, enhanced a hundred-fold.\\n\\n\\'The next wreath I adjust on this fair head, will be a marriage wreath,\\' said Grace; \\'or I am no true prophet, dear.\\'\\n\\nHer sister smiled, and held her in her arms.\\n\\n\\'A moment, Grace. Don\\'t leave me yet. Are you sure that I want nothing more?\\'\\n\\nHer care was not for that. It was her sister\\'s face she thought of, and her eyes were fixed upon it, tenderly.\\n\\n\\'My art,\\' said Grace, \\'can go no farther, dear girl; nor your beauty. I never saw you look so beautiful as now.\\'\\n\\n\\'I never was so happy,\\' she returned.\\n\\n\\'Ay, but there is a greater happiness in store. In such another home, as cheerful and as bright as this looks now,\\' said Grace, \\'Alfred and his young wife will soon be living.\\'\\n\\nShe smiled again. \\'It is a happy home, Grace, in your fancy. I can see it in your eyes. I know it WILL be happy, dear. How glad I am to know it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Well,\\' cried the Doctor, bustling in. \\'Here we are, all ready for Alfred, eh? He can\\'t be here until pretty late - an hour or so before midnight - so there\\'ll be plenty of time for making merry before he comes. He\\'ll not find us with the ice unbroken. Pile up the fire here, Britain! Let it shine upon the holly till it winks again. It\\'s a world of nonsense, Puss; true lovers and all the rest of it - all nonsense; but we\\'ll be nonsensical with the rest of \\'em, and give our true lover a mad welcome. Upon my word!\\' said the old Doctor, looking at his daughters proudly, \\'I\\'m not clear to-night, among other absurdities, but that I\\'m the father of two handsome girls.\\'\\n\\n\\'All that one of them has ever done, or may do - may do, dearest father - to cause you pain or grief, forgive her,\\' said Marion, \\'forgive her now, when her heart is full. Say that you forgive her. That you will forgive her. That she shall always share your love, and -,\\' and the rest was not said, for her face was hidden on the old man\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\\'Tut, tut, tut,\\' said the Doctor gently. \\'Forgive! What have I to forgive? Heyday, if our true lovers come back to flurry us like this, we must hold \\'em at a distance; we must send expresses out to stop \\'em short upon the road, and bring \\'em on a mile or two a day, until we\\'re properly prepared to meet \\'em. Kiss me, Puss. Forgive! Why, what a silly child you are! If you had vexed and crossed me fifty times a day, instead of not at all, I\\'d forgive you everything, but such a supplication. Kiss me again, Puss. There! Prospective and retrospective - a clear score between us. Pile up the fire here! Would you freeze the people on this bleak December night! Let us be light, and warm, and merry, or I\\'ll not forgive some of you!\\'\\n\\nSo gaily the old Doctor carried it! And the fire was piled up, and the lights were bright, and company arrived, and a murmuring of lively tongues began, and already there was a pleasant air of cheerful excitement stirring through all the house.\\n\\nMore and more company came flocking in. Bright eyes sparkled upon Marion; smiling lips gave her joy of his return; sage mothers fanned themselves, and hoped she mightn\\'t be too youthful and inconstant for the quiet round of home; impetuous fathers fell into disgrace for too much exaltation of her beauty; daughters envied her; sons envied him; innumerable pairs of lovers profited by the occasion; all were interested, animated, and expectant.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Craggs came arm in arm, but Mrs. Snitchey came alone.\\n\\'Why, what\\'s become of HIM?\\' inquired the Doctor.\\nThe feather of a Bird of Paradise in Mrs. Snitchey\\'s turban, trembled as if the Bird of Paradise were alive again, when she said that doubtless Mr. Craggs knew. SHE was never told.\\n\\n\\'That nasty office,\\' said Mrs. Craggs.\\n\\n\\'I wish it was burnt down,\\' said Mrs. Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'He\\'s - he\\'s - there\\'s a little matter of business that keeps my partner rather late,\\' said Mr. Craggs, looking uneasily about him.\\n\\n\\'Oh-h! Business. Don\\'t tell me!\\' said Mrs. Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'WE know what business means,\\' said Mrs. Craggs.\\n\\nBut their not knowing what it meant, was perhaps the reason why Mrs. Snitchey\\'s Bird of Paradise feather quivered so portentously, and why all the pendant bits on Mrs. Craggs\\'s ear-rings shook like little bells.\\n\\n\\'I wonder YOU could come away, Mr. Craggs,\\' said his wife.\\n\\n\\'Mr. Craggs is fortunate, I\\'m sure!\\' said Mrs. Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'That office so engrosses \\'em,\\' said Mrs. Craggs.\\n\\n\\'A person with an office has no business to be married at all,\\' said Mrs. Snitchey.\\n\\nThen, Mrs. Snitchey said, within herself, that that look of hers had pierced to Craggs\\'s soul, and he knew it; and Mrs. Craggs observed to Craggs, that \\'his Snitcheys\\' were deceiving him behind his back, and he would find it out when it was too late.\\n\\nStill, Mr. Craggs, without much heeding these remarks, looked uneasily about until his eye rested on Grace, to whom he immediately presented himself.\\n\\n\\'Good evening, ma\\'am,\\' said Craggs. \\'You look charmingly. Your -\\nMiss - your sister, Miss Marion, is she - \\'\\n\\'Oh, she\\'s quite well, Mr. Craggs.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes - I - is she here?\\' asked Craggs.\\n\\n\\'Here! Don\\'t you see her yonder? Going to dance?\\' said Grace.\\n\\nMr. Craggs put on his spectacles to see the better; looked at her through them, for some time; coughed; and put them, with an air of satisfaction, in their sheath again, and in his pocket.\\n\\nNow the music struck up, and the dance commenced. The bright fire crackled and sparkled, rose and fell, as though it joined the dance itself, in right good fellowship. Sometimes, it roared as if it would make music too. Sometimes, it flashed and beamed as if it were the eye of the old room: it winked too, sometimes, like a knowing patriarch, upon the youthful whisperers in corners. Sometimes, it sported with the holly-boughs; and, shining on the leaves by fits and starts, made them look as if they were in the cold winter night again, and fluttering in the wind. Sometimes its genial humour grew obstreperous, and passed all bounds; and then it cast into the room, among the twinkling feet, with a loud burst, a shower of harmless little sparks, and in its exultation leaped and bounded, like a mad thing, up the broad old chimney.\\n\\nAnother dance was near its close, when Mr. Snitchey touched his partner, who was looking on, upon the arm.\\n\\nMr. Craggs started, as if his familiar had been a spectre.\\n\\n\\'Is he gone?\\' he asked.\\n\\n\\'Hush! He has been with me,\\' said Snitchey, \\'for three hours and more. He went over everything. He looked into all our arrangements for him, and was very particular indeed. He - Humph!\\'\\n\\nThe dance was finished. Marion passed close before him, as he spoke. She did not observe him, or his partner; but, looked over her shoulder towards her sister in the distance, as she slowly made her way into the crowd, and passed out of their view.\\n\\n\\'You see! All safe and well,\\' said Mr. Craggs. \\'He didn\\'t recur to that subject, I suppose?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not a word.\\'\\n\\n\\'And is he really gone? Is he safe away?\\'\\n\\n\\'He keeps to his word. He drops down the river with the tide in that shell of a boat of his, and so goes out to sea on this dark night! - a dare-devil he is - before the wind. There\\'s no such lonely road anywhere else. That\\'s one thing. The tide flows, he says, an hour before midnight - about this time. I\\'m glad it\\'s over.\\' Mr. Snitchey wiped his forehead, which looked hot and anxious.\\n\\n\\'What do you think,\\' said Mr. Craggs, \\'about - \\'\\n\\n\\'Hush!\\' replied his cautious partner, looking straight before him. \\'I understand you. Don\\'t mention names, and don\\'t let us, seem to be talking secrets. I don\\'t know what to think; and to tell you the truth, I don\\'t care now. It\\'s a great relief. His self-love deceived him, I suppose. Perhaps the young lady coquetted a little. The evidence would seem to point that way. Alfred not arrived?\\'\\n\\n\\'Not yet,\\' said Mr. Craggs. \\'Expected every minute.\\'\\n\\n\\'Good.\\' Mr. Snitchey wiped his forehead again. \\'It\\'s a great relief. I haven\\'t been so nervous since we\\'ve been in partnership. I intend to spend the evening now, Mr. Craggs.\\'\\n\\nMrs. Craggs and Mrs. Snitchey joined them as he announced this intention. The Bird of Paradise was in a state of extreme vibration, and the little bells were ringing quite audibly.\\n\\n\\'It has been the theme of general comment, Mr. Snitchey,\\' said Mrs.\\nSnitchey. \\'I hope the office is satisfied.\\'\\n\\'Satisfied with what, my dear?\\' asked Mr. Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'With the exposure of a defenceless woman to ridicule and remark,\\' returned his wife. \\'That is quite in the way of the office, THAT is.\\'\\n\\n\\'I really, myself,\\' said Mrs. Craggs, \\'have been so long accustomed to connect the office with everything opposed to domesticity, that I am glad to know it as the avowed enemy of my peace. There is something honest in that, at all events.\\'\\n\\n\\'My dear,\\' urged Mr. Craggs, \\'your good opinion is invaluable, but\\nI never avowed that the office was the enemy of your peace.\\'\\n\\'No,\\' said Mrs. Craggs, ringing a perfect peal upon the little bells. \\'Not you, indeed. You wouldn\\'t be worthy of the office, if you had the candour to.\\'\\n\\n\\'As to my having been away to-night, my dear,\\' said Mr. Snitchey, giving her his arm, \\'the deprivation has been mine, I\\'m sure; but, as Mr. Craggs knows - \\'\\n\\nMrs. Snitchey cut this reference very short by hitching her husband to a distance, and asking him to look at that man. To do her the favour to look at him!\\n\\n\\'At which man, my dear?\\' said Mr. Snitchey.\\n\\n\\'Your chosen companion; I\\'M no companion to you, Mr. Snitchey.\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes, yes, you are, my dear,\\' he interposed.\\n\\n\\'No, no, I\\'m not,\\' said Mrs. Snitchey with a majestic smile. \\'I know my station. Will you look at your chosen companion, Mr. Snitchey; at your referee, at the keeper of your secrets, at the man you trust; at your other self, in short?\\'\\n\\nThe habitual association of Self with Craggs, occasioned Mr.\\nSnitchey to look in that direction.\\n\\'If you can look that man in the eye this night,\\' said Mrs. Snitchey, \\'and not know that you are deluded, practised upon, made the victim of his arts, and bent down prostrate to his will by some unaccountable fascination which it is impossible to explain and against which no warning of mine is of the least avail, all I can say is - I pity you!\\'\\n\\nAt the very same moment Mrs. Craggs was oracular on the cross subject. Was it possible, she said, that Craggs could so blind himself to his Snitcheys, as not to feel his true position? Did he mean to say that he had seen his Snitcheys come into that room, and didn\\'t plainly see that there was reservation, cunning, treachery, in the man? Would he tell her that his very action, when he wiped his forehead and looked so stealthily about him, didn\\'t show that there was something weighing on the conscience of his precious Snitcheys (if he had a conscience), that wouldn\\'t bear the light? Did anybody but his Snitcheys come to festive entertainments like a burglar? - which, by the way, was hardly a clear illustration of the case, as he had walked in very mildly at the door. And would he still assert to her at noon-day (it being nearly midnight), that his Snitcheys were to be justified through thick and thin, against all facts, and reason, and experience?\\n\\nNeither Snitchey nor Craggs openly attempted to stem the current which had thus set in, but, both were content to be carried gently along it, until its force abated. This happened at about the same time as a general movement for a country dance; when Mr. Snitchey proposed himself as a partner to Mrs. Craggs, and Mr. Craggs gallantly offered himself to Mrs. Snitchey; and after some such slight evasions as \\'why don\\'t you ask somebody else?\\' and \\'you\\'ll be glad, I know, if I decline,\\' and \\'I wonder you can dance out of the office\\' (but this jocosely now), each lady graciously accepted, and took her place.\\n\\nIt was an old custom among them, indeed, to do so, and to pair off, in like manner, at dinners and suppers; for they were excellent friends, and on a footing of easy familiarity. Perhaps the false Craggs and the wicked Snitchey were a recognised fiction with the two wives, as Doe and Roe, incessantly running up and down bailiwicks, were with the two husbands: or, perhaps the ladies had instituted, and taken upon themselves, these two shares in the business, rather than be left out of it altogether. But, certain it is, that each wife went as gravely and steadily to work in her vocation as her husband did in his, and would have considered it almost impossible for the Firm to maintain a successful and respectable existence, without her laudable exertions.\\n\\nBut, now, the Bird of Paradise was seen to flutter down the middle; and the little bells began to bounce and jingle in poussette; and the Doctor\\'s rosy face spun round and round, like an expressive pegtop highly varnished; and breathless Mr. Craggs began to doubt already, whether country dancing had been made \\'too easy,\\' like the rest of life; and Mr. Snitchey, with his nimble cuts and capers, footed it for Self and Craggs, and half-a-dozen more.\\n\\nNow, too, the fire took fresh courage, favoured by the lively wind the dance awakened, and burnt clear and high. It was the Genius of the room, and present everywhere. It shone in people\\'s eyes, it sparkled in the jewels on the snowy necks of girls, it twinkled at their ears as if it whispered to them slyly, it flashed about their waists, it flickered on the ground and made it rosy for their feet, it bloomed upon the ceiling that its glow might set off their bright faces, and it kindled up a general illumination in Mrs. Craggs\\'s little belfry.\\n\\nNow, too, the lively air that fanned it, grew less gentle as the music quickened and the dance proceeded with new spirit; and a breeze arose that made the leaves and berries dance upon the wall, as they had often done upon the trees; and the breeze rustled in the room as if an invisible company of fairies, treading in the foot-steps of the good substantial revellers, were whirling after them. Now, too, no feature of the Doctor\\'s face could be distinguished as he spun and spun; and now there seemed a dozen Birds of Paradise in fitful flight; and now there were a thousand little bells at work; and now a fleet of flying skirts was ruffled by a little tempest, when the music gave in, and the dance was over.\\n\\nHot and breathless as the Doctor was, it only made him the more impatient for Alfred\\'s coming.\\n\\n\\'Anything been seen, Britain? Anything been heard?\\'\\n\\n\\'Too dark to see far, sir. Too much noise inside the house to hear.\\'\\n\\n\\'That\\'s right! The gayer welcome for him. How goes the time?\\'\\n\\n\\'Just twelve, sir. He can\\'t be long, sir.\\'\\n\\n\\'Stir up the fire, and throw another log upon it,\\' said the Doctor. \\'Let him see his welcome blazing out upon the night - good boy! - as he comes along!\\'\\n\\nHe saw it - Yes! From the chaise he caught the light, as he turned the corner by the old church. He knew the room from which it shone. He saw the wintry branches of the old trees between the light and him. He knew that one of those trees rustled musically in the summer time at the window of Marion\\'s chamber.\\n\\nThe tears were in his eyes. His heart throbbed so violently that he could hardly bear his happiness. How often he had thought of this time - pictured it under all circumstances - feared that it might never come - yearned, and wearied for it - far away!\\n\\nAgain the light! Distinct and ruddy; kindled, he knew, to give him welcome, and to speed him home. He beckoned with his hand, and waved his hat, and cheered out, loud, as if the light were they, and they could see and hear him, as he dashed towards them through the mud and mire, triumphantly.\\n\\nStop! He knew the Doctor, and understood what he had done. He would not let it be a surprise to them. But he could make it one, yet, by going forward on foot. If the orchard-gate were open, he could enter there; if not, the wall was easily climbed, as he knew of old; and he would be among them in an instant.\\n\\nHe dismounted from the chaise, and telling the driver - even that was not easy in his agitation - to remain behind for a few minutes, and then to follow slowly, ran on with exceeding swiftness, tried the gate, scaled the wall, jumped down on the other side, and stood panting in the old orchard.\\n\\nThere was a frosty rime upon the trees, which, in the faint light of the clouded moon, hung upon the smaller branches like dead garlands. Withered leaves crackled and snapped beneath his feet, as he crept softly on towards the house. The desolation of a winter night sat brooding on the earth, and in the sky. But, the red light came cheerily towards him from the windows; figures passed and repassed there; and the hum and murmur of voices greeted his ear sweetly.\\n\\nListening for hers: attempting, as he crept on, to detach it from the rest, and half believing that he heard it: he had nearly reached the door, when it was abruptly opened, and a figure coming out encountered his. It instantly recoiled with a half-suppressed cry.\\n\\n\\'Clemency,\\' he said, \\'don\\'t you know me?\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t come in!\\' she answered, pushing him back. \\'Go away. Don\\'t ask me why. Don\\'t come in.\\'\\n\\n\\'What is the matter?\\' he exclaimed.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know. I - I am afraid to think. Go back. Hark!\\'\\n\\nThere was a sudden tumult in the house. She put her hands upon her ears. A wild scream, such as no hands could shut out, was heard; and Grace - distraction in her looks and manner - rushed out at the door.\\n\\n\\'Grace!\\' He caught her in his arms. \\'What is it! Is she dead!\\'\\n\\nShe disengaged herself, as if to recognise his face, and fell down at his feet.\\n\\nA crowd of figures came about them from the house. Among them was her father, with a paper in his hand.\\n\\n\\'What is it!\\' cried Alfred, grasping his hair with his hands, and looking in an agony from face to face, as he bent upon his knee beside the insensible girl. \\'Will no one look at me? Will no one speak to me? Does no one know me? Is there no voice among you all, to tell me what it is!\\'\\n\\nThere was a murmur among them. \\'She is gone.\\'\\n\\n\\'Gone!\\' he echoed.\\n\\n\\'Fled, my dear Alfred!\\' said the Doctor, in a broken voice, and with his hands before his face. \\'Gone from her home and us. To- night! She writes that she has made her innocent and blameless choice - entreats that we will forgive her - prays that we will not forget her - and is gone.\\'\\n\\n\\'With whom? Where?\\'\\n\\nHe started up, as if to follow in pursuit; but, when they gave way to let him pass, looked wildly round upon them, staggered back, and sunk down in his former attitude, clasping one of Grace\\'s cold hands in his own.\\n\\nThere was a hurried running to and fro, confusion, noise, disorder, and no purpose. Some proceeded to disperse themselves about the roads, and some took horse, and some got lights, and some conversed together, urging that there was no trace or track to follow. Some approached him kindly, with the view of offering consolation; some admonished him that Grace must be removed into the house, and that he prevented it. He never heard them, and he never moved.\\n\\nThe snow fell fast and thick. He looked up for a moment in the air, and thought that those white ashes strewn upon his hopes and misery, were suited to them well. He looked round on the whitening ground, and thought how Marion\\'s foot-prints would be hushed and covered up, as soon as made, and even that remembrance of her blotted out. But he never felt the weather and he never stirred.',\n",

       " \"Claude Frollo.\\n\\nIn fact, Claude Frollo was no common person.\\n\\nHe belonged to one of those middle-class families which were called indifferently, in the impertinent language of the last century, the high bourgeoise or the petty nobility. This family had inherited from the brothers Paclet the fief of Tirechappe, which was dependent upon the Bishop of Paris, and whose twenty-one houses had been in the thirteenth century the object of so many suits before the official. As possessor of this fief, Claude Frollo was one of the twenty-seven seigneurs keeping claim to a manor in fee in Paris and its suburbs; and for a long time, his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality, between the Hôtel de Tancarville, belonging to Master François Le Rez, and the college of Tours, in the records deposited at Saint Martin des Champs.\\n\\nClaude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession. He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low. While still a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in the University. There it was that he had grown up, on the missal and the lexicon.\\n\\nMoreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to dare alapas et capillos laniare, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of “The sixth trouble of the University.” He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the cappettes from which they derived their name, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure, and their surtout parti-colored of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth, azurini coloris et bruni, as says the charter of the Cardinal des Quatre-Couronnes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais. The first pupil whom the Abbé de Saint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers. The first auditor whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo. Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.\\n\\nTheology conquered, he had plunged into decretals. From the “Master of Sentences,” he had passed to the “Capitularies of Charlemagne;” and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon decretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal of Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then the collection of Gregory IX.; then the Epistle of Superspecula, of Honorius III. He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife with each other, in the chaos of the Middle Ages,—a period which Bishop Theodore opens in 618, and which Pope Gregory closes in 1227.\\n\\nDecretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts. He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses. Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon. He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master, and doctor of arts. He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented. His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science. At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.\\n\\n\\nIt was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, “Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant.” The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady. It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief. The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion. When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day. A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle. This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood. Up to that moment, he had lived only in science; he now began to live in life.\\n\\nThis catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence. Orphaned, the eldest, head of the family at the age of nineteen, he felt himself rudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this world. Then, moved with pity, he was seized with passion and devotion towards that child, his brother; a sweet and strange thing was a human affection to him, who had hitherto loved his books alone.\\nThis affection developed to a singular point; in a soul so new, it was like a first love. Separated since infancy from his parents, whom he had hardly known; cloistered and immured, as it were, in his books; eager above all things to study and to learn; exclusively attentive up to that time, to his intelligence which broadened in science, to his imagination, which expanded in letters,—the poor scholar had not yet had time to feel the place of his heart.\\n\\nThis young brother, without mother or father, this little child which had fallen abruptly from heaven into his arms, made a new man of him. He perceived that there was something else in the world besides the speculations of the Sorbonne, and the verses of Homer; that man needed affections; that life without tenderness and without love was only a set of dry, shrieking, and rending wheels. Only, he imagined, for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.\\n\\nHe threw himself, therefore, into the love for his little Jehan with the passion of a character already profound, ardent, concentrated; that poor frail creature, pretty, fair-haired, rosy, and curly,—that orphan with another orphan for his only support, touched him to the bottom of his heart; and grave thinker as he was, he set to meditating upon Jehan with an infinite compassion. He kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile, and very worthy of care. He was more than a brother to the child; he became a mother to him.\\n\\nLittle Jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast; Claude gave him to a nurse. Besides the fief of Tirechappe, he had inherited from his father the fief of Moulin, which was a dependency of the square tower of Gentilly; it was a mill on a hill, near the château of Winchestre (Bicêtre). There was a miller's wife there who was nursing a fine child; it was not far from the university, and Claude carried the little Jehan to her in his own arms.\\n\\nFrom that time forth, feeling that he had a burden to bear, he took life very seriously. The thought of his little brother became not only his recreation, but the object of his studies. He resolved to consecrate himself entirely to a future for which he was responsible in the sight of God, and never to have any other wife, any other child than the happiness and fortune of his brother. Therefore, he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession. His merits, his learning, his quality of immediate vassal of the Bishop of Paris, threw the doors of the church wide open to him. At the age of twenty, by special dispensation of the Holy See, he was a priest, and served as the youngest of the chaplains of Notre-Dame the altar which is called, because of the late mass which is said there,altare pigrorum.\\n\\nThere, plunged more deeply than ever in his dear books, which he quitted only to run for an hour to the fief of Moulin, this mixture of learning and austerity, so rare at his age, had promptly acquired for him the respect and admiration of the monastery. From the cloister, his reputation as a learned man had passed to the people, among whom it had changed a little, a frequent occurrence at that time, into reputation as a sorcerer.\\n\\nIt was at the moment when he was returning, on Quasimodo day, from saying his mass at the Altar of the Lazy, which was by the side of the door leading to the nave on the right, near the image of the Virgin, that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women chattering around the bed for foundlings.\\n\\nThen it was that he approached the unhappy little creature, which was so hated and so menaced. That distress, that deformity, that abandonment, the thought of his young brother, the idea which suddenly occurred to him, that if he were to die, his dear little Jehan might also be flung miserably on the plank for foundlings,—all this had gone to his heart simultaneously; a great pity had moved in him, and he had carried off the child.\\n\\nWhen he removed the child from the sack, he found it greatly deformed, in very sooth. The poor little wretch had a wart on his left eye, his head placed directly on his shoulders, his spinal column was crooked, his breast bone prominent, and his legs bowed; but he appeared to be lively; and although it was impossible to say in what language he lisped, his cry indicated considerable force and health. Claude's compassion increased at the sight of this ugliness; and he made a vow in his heart to rear the child for the love of his brother, in order that, whatever might be the future faults of the little Jehan, he should have beside him that charity done for his sake. It was a sort of investment of good works, which he was effecting in the name of his young brother; it was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for him, in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that coin, the only sort which is received at the toll-bar of paradise.\\n\\nHe baptized his adopted child, and gave him the name of Quasimodo, either because he desired thereby to mark the day, when he had found him, or because he wished to designate by that name to what a degree the poor little creature was incomplete, and hardly sketched out. In fact, Quasimodo, blind, hunchbacked, knock-kneed, was only an “almost.”\",\n",

How have I disobliged you? What is my Offence? I beseech you, tell me.\\n\\n*Ask the inconstant Ariamenes, reply'd Ara Bella , the Offence of the ungrateful Glanville. The Betrayer of Cynecia can best answer that Question to the Deceiver of Ara Bella . And the Guilt of the one can only be compared to the Crimes of the other. [*This Enigmatic Way of speaking upon such Occasions, is of great Use in the voluminous French Romances, since the Doubt and Confusion it is is the Cause of, both to the Accused and Accuser, gives Rise to a great Number of succeeding Mistakes, and consequently Adventures.]\\n\\nGood God! interrupted Mr. Glanville fretting excessively, What am I to understand by all this? On my Soul, Madam, I don't know the Meaning of one Word you say.\\nOh Dissembler! said Ara Bella, Is it thus that thou would'st impose upon my Credulity? Does not the Name of Ariamenes make thee tremble then? And can'st thou hear that of Cynecia without Confusion?\\n\\nDear Lady Bella, said Glanville smiling, What are these Names to me?\\n\\nFalse Man, interrupted Ara Bella, Dost thou presume to sport with thy Crimes then? Are not the Treacheries of Ariamenes the Crimes ofGlanville? Could Ariamenes be false to the Princess of Gaul, and canGlanville be innocent towards Ara Bella?\\n\\nMr. Glanville, who had never heard her in his Opinion, talk so ridiculously before, was so amazed at the incomprehensible Stuff she utter'd with so much Emotion, that he began to fear her Intellects were really touch'd. This Thought gave him a Concern that spread itself in a Moment over his Countenance. He gazed on her with a fix'd Attention, dreading, yet wishing she would speak again; equally divided between his Hopes, that her next Speech would remove his Suspicion, and his Fears, that it might more confirm them.\\n\\nAra Bella taking Notice of his pensive Posture, turned away her Head, lest by beholding him, she should relent, and treat him with less Severity than she had intended; making at the same Time a Sign to him to be gone.\\n\\nIndeed, Lady Bella, said Glanville who understood her perfectly well, I cannot leave you in this Temper. I must know how I have been so unfortunate as to offend you.\\n\\nAra Bella, no longer able to contain herself, burst into Tears at this Question: With one Hand she made repeated Signs to him to be gone, with the other she held her Handkerchief to her Eyes, vex'd and ashamed of her Weakness.\\n\\nBut Mr. Glanville, excessively shocked at this Sight, instead of leaving her, threw himself on his Knees before her, and taking her Hand, which he tenderly prest to his Lips,\\n\\nGood God! my dearest Cousin, said he, How you distract me by this Behavior! Sure something extraordinary must be the Matter. What can it be that thus afflicts you? Am I the Cause of these Tears? Can I have offended you so much? Speak, dear Madam Let me know my Crime. Yet may I perish if I am conscious of any towards you.\\n\\nDisloyal Man, said Ara Bella disengaging her Hand from his, Does then the Crime of Ariamenes seem so light in thy Apprehension, that thou can'st hope to be thought innocent by Ara Bella? No, no, ungrateful Man, the unfortunate Cynecia shall have no Cause to say, that I will triumph in her Spoils. I myself will be the Minister of her Revenge; and Glanville shall suffer for the Crime of Ariamenes.\\n\\nWho the Devil is this Ariamenes, cried Glanville rising in a Passion? And why am I to suffer for his Crime, pray? For Heavens Sake, dear Cousin, don't let your Imagination wander thus. Upon my Soul, I don't believe there is any such Person as Ariamenes in the World.\\n\\nVile Equivocator, said Ara Bella; Ariamenes, tho' dead to Cynecia, is alive to the deluded Ara Bella. The Crimes of Ariamenes are the Guilt of Glanville: And if the one has made himself unworthy of the Princess of Gaul, by his Perfidy and Ingratitude, the other by his Baseness and Deceit, merits nothing but Contempt and Detestation from AraBella.\\n\\nFrenzy, by my Soul, cry'd Glanville mutteringly between his Teeth: This is downright Frenzy. What shall I do?\\nHence, from my Presence, resumed Ara Bella, false and ungrateful Man; persecute me no more with the hateful Offers of thy Love. From this Moment I banish thee from my Thoughts for ever; and neither as Glanville or as Ariamenes, will I ever behold thee more.\\n\\nStay, dear Cousin, said Glanville holding her (for she was endeavoring to rush by him, unwilling he should see the Tears that had overspread her Face as she pronounced those Words) hear me, I beg you, but one Word. Who is it you mean by Ariamenes?  Is it me? Tell me Madam, I beseech you This is some horrid Mistake You have been imposed upon by some villainous Artifice Speak, dear Lady BellaIs it me you mean by Ariamenes? For so your last Words seem'd to hint.\\n\\nAra Bella, without regarding what he said, struggled violently to force her Hand from his: and finding him still earnest to detain her, told him with an enraged Voice, That she would call for Help, if he did not unhand her directly.\\n\\nPoor Glanville, at this Menace, submissively dropt her Hand; and the Moment she was free, she flew out of the Room, and locking herself up in her Closet, sent her Commands to him by one of her Women, whom she call'd to her, to leave her Apartment immediately.\",\n",
